# LifeOS — Agent Reference

> **Audience:** All AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
> **Status:** Complete
> **Last Updated:** 2026-09-04

LifeOS is a self-hosted personal AI assistant with two halves:

1. **A context layer** — indexes personal data (notes, emails, messages, photos, calendar, contacts, financial data) into a unified semantically-searchable corpus with cross-source entity resolution.
2. **An agentic layer** — an agent worker plus chat/Telegram/MCP/**voice (whisper-relay)** surfaces that autonomously complete multi-step tasks against that context (drafting, scheduling, researching, prepping) and report progress as they work.

Runs on Linux or macOS. Optionally, a Mac can act as an Apple Data Agent for iMessage, phone calls, and contacts.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Two-tier data model**: SourceEntity (raw observations from each data source) → PersonEntity (canonical, merged records per person). See [ADR-003](docs/adr/003-two-tier-data-model.md).
- **Hybrid search**: Vector similarity (ChromaDB) + keyword matching (BM25/FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. See [ADR-004](docs/adr/004-hybrid-search.md).
- **Entity resolution**: Links emails, phones, and names across sources to canonical people using fuzzy matching with scoring.
- **Sync phases**: Seven-phase nightly pipeline — Collection → Entity Processing → Relationship Building → Indexing → Content Sync → Entity Cleanup → Consistency Verification.
- **Agentic chat**: Orchestrator LLM autonomously calls 15+ tools (search, calendar, email, tasks, etc.) across multiple rounds to answer queries.
- **Agent worker**: Autonomous executor for engine-assigned tasks (or work delegated from chat/Telegram). Runs long, multi-step sessions with the full MCP tool catalog, reports progress through the originating channel, and routes to local Gemma, cloud Claude via Managed Agents, or a configured remote provider (`#cloud`, `#local`, etc. sub-tags; `LIFEOS_AGENT_DEFAULT_ROUTE`). See [specs/product/agent-worker.md](docs/specs/product/agent-worker.md).
- **HTTP client surfaces**: Web chat, Telegram, whisper-relay (voice), and the Hermes gateway (an external front door persona bots can route Telegram turns through) share a stable HTTP contract — see [specs/technical/client-surfaces.md](docs/specs/technical/client-surfaces.md) before changing chat or conversation APIs.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | FastAPI (port 8000) |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB (port 8001) |
| Keyword Search | SQLite FTS5 (BM25) |
| Intent classifier | Claude Haiku via Anthropic API (default); pattern-matching fallback when the API is unavailable |
| LLM (orchestration + synthesis) | Claude via Anthropic API (default), a local OpenAI-compatible llama-server (`LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=local`), or any other OpenAI-compatible remote provider such as Fireworks (`LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=remote`, `LIFEOS_REMOTE_LLM_*` — no Anthropic key required; see [ADR-024](docs/adr/024-remote-llm-backend.md)). Base model set by `LIFEOS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5`). Per-query escalation (Anthropic backend) sits on top: user-directed ("escalate to opus", "use codex") and automatic on refusal+pushback, via `LIFEOS_AGENT_ESCALATION_MODEL` / `LIFEOS_AGENT_ESCALATION_LADDER`. **Automatic escalation only climbs to non-API engines** (`claude_code`, `codex`, `local`); reaching an API model takes an explicit request from the operator. Specialist calls (relationship insights, fact extraction) fall back Anthropic → local → remote on a keyless install, never erroring — see [ADR-025](docs/adr/025-specialist-call-fallback.md) |
| LLM Client | `api/services/llm_client.py` — unified wrapper with Anthropic↔OpenAI tool format translation |
| Embeddings | sentence-transformers (GPU via ROCm/CUDA) |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/JS (no build step) |
| Job Queue | SQLite-backed background workers |
| Scheduler | Markdown source of truth (`LifeOS/Scheduler/Inbox.md`) + rebuildable index cache; 60s cron tick |
| Service Management | systemd (Linux) / launchd (macOS) |

## Development Principles

These apply to all agents. Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Acting

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For non-trivial features, follow this cycle:

1. Define requirements (what does "done" look like?)
2. Write tests that pass if and only if requirements are met
3. Plan the implementation approach
4. Implement — deliver production code and tests together
5. Adversarial review — compare implementation against requirements; identify gaps, missed edge cases, deviations from spec
6. Close gaps and re-verify

Steps 5–6 repeat until no meaningful gaps remain.

For smaller tasks, a brief inline plan suffices:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]

### 5. Tests Are Sacred

- Never skip or weaken tests to make code pass.
- All fixes must consider effects on the full system, not just one test.
- Pre-existing test failures are documented — don't "fix" them without understanding context.

**When an existing test fails after your changes:**

The default assumption is that your code is wrong, not the test. Before modifying any test, answer:
1. What was this test originally meant to verify?
2. Why is it failing — what specific change caused it?
3. Is the correct fix to (a) fix your code, (b) update the test for intentionally changed behavior, or (c) remove the test because the behavior no longer exists?

Option (a) is the default. Options (b) and (c) require explicit justification.

**Never:**
- Delete a failing test to make the suite pass.
- Mark a test as skipped/xfail to unblock a commit.
- Rewrite a test you don't fully understand.
- Assume a flaky test is "just flaky" without investigating.

### 6. Privacy Is Non-Negotiable

- LifeOS handles deeply personal data: emails, messages, photos, finances, therapy notes.
- Never log, expose, or transmit personal data beyond what the system requires.
- All data stays local. LLM inference runs locally — no data leaves the machine.
- Use obviously synthetic data in all documentation and test fixtures.
- Security-sensitive implementation details belong in code, not docs.
- When in doubt about whether something is a privacy concern, treat it as one.

## Boundaries

Quick-reference guardrails for all contributors. These complement the Development Principles above with a scannable list.

| Tier | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Always** | Obtain current evidence for every lane selected by the lifecycle contract before commit; run broad gates when the current repository gate requires them |
| **Always** | Restart server after **deploying** Python changes (test-only runs in isolated copies don't need it) |
| **Always** | Use `./scripts/server.sh` for server management |
| **Always** | Use obviously synthetic data in tests and docs |
| **Ask first** | Database schema changes (new or altered tables) |
| **Ask first** | Adding new third-party dependencies |
| **Ask first** | Public API changes (new or modified endpoints) |
| **Ask first** | Changes to sync pipeline phases or cron jobs |
| **Ask first** | Changes to MCP tool definitions |
| **Ask first** | Breaking changes to HTTP client contract — see [client-surfaces.md](docs/specs/technical/client-surfaces.md) |
| **Never** | Commit secrets, credentials, or API keys |
| **Never** | Force push to main (sole exception: `merge-pr`'s post-merge timestamp normalization) |
| **Never** | Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`) |
| **Never** | Log, print, or expose real personal data |
| **Never** | Run uvicorn directly (use `./scripts/server.sh`) |

---

## Development Workflow

**Branch naming:** `<type>/<short-description>` where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Lowercase, hyphen-separated.

1. **Edit code**
2. **Test**: obtain current evidence for the selected lane(s) with `./scripts/test.sh` or the applicable isolated runner
3. **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy.sh "Your commit message"`; deployment owns any production restart

`deploy.sh` is the direct-to-main hotfix path. PR-based work (e.g. `/implement`) uses feature branches + `merge-pr` and never calls `deploy.sh`.

## Dependency Management

**Single source of truth**: `requirements.txt`
**Virtual environment**: `~/.venvs/lifeos` (external — see [ADR-005](docs/adr/005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md))

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add to `requirements.txt`
2. Install: `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Restart the deployed server: `./scripts/server.sh restart` (an isolated test run never restarts production)

### Testing

```bash
./scripts/test.sh              # Unit tests (fast, ~30s)
./scripts/test.sh smoke        # Unit + critical browser (used by deploy)
./scripts/test.sh all          # Full test suite
```

- **No local venv (the MacBook)** — `./scripts/test.sh` only runs where a venv exists (the server). From the Mac, run **`./scripts/remote-test.sh`**: it rsyncs your uncommitted working tree to an isolated branch-keyed dir on the test-runner host and runs the same `test.sh auto` scope there. Set `LIFEOS_REMOTE_HOST` to that host's ssh target first (there is no default) — put it in your shell profile so it persists. Get a green run **before** committing — no push required, and committing/pushing "so tests can run" is neither necessary nor allowed.
- **Parallelism:** unit tests run under pytest-xdist (`-n auto --dist loadscope`) — reproduce flakes in that mode, not sequentially.
- **Co-scheduling a `browser`-marked file with an unrelated `async def` test in one invocation can fail nondeterministically.** Under `--dist loadscope`, scope groups (a test class, or a module's top-level functions) are handed to workers largest-first — pytest-xdist's `--loadscope-reorder` is on by default — with command-line order only breaking ties, so which groups share a worker process, and in what sequence, shifts with the selection; a bug that manifests only once a browser test's fixtures have *already run* in the same worker process can appear or vanish with an unrelated change to the file set. Do not bisect such a flake by shuffling file order under xdist. Run the browser file and the suspect test together in ONE process, no `-n`, browser file first — sequential order is then exactly command-line order, so the run is deterministic:
  `pytest tests/some_x_ui_browser.py tests/the_suspect_test.py -q`. The concrete hazard: pytest-playwright's sync-API driver connection parks an event loop for the fixture's whole lifetime, which can make an unrelated `async def` test that runs after it in the same process fail. `tests/conftest.py`'s comment above the module-scoped UI-driver fixture overrides carries the mechanism and both the minimal and the real-suite reproducer.
- **Browser tests:** the web SPA is served at `/chat` (not `/`); `test.sh browser` covers only `test_ui_browser.py`, `test_e2e_flow.py`, and `test_voice_mic_block_ui_browser.py` — run new browser test files directly with pytest.
- **What the pre-push hook skips:** a docs-only push and a deletion-only push skip the suites; everything else runs them in full. The docs-only judgement is `test.sh`'s `decide_plan`, called by the hook rather than reimplemented — so dependency manifests (`requirements*.txt`, `constraints*.txt`) still run tests despite the `.txt` extension. The hook never runs a narrowed subset: a prior failure changes test *order* (`--ff`), never which tests are selected. Each run writes to a per-branch, per-process log under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/lifeos-prepush/` (path printed before each suite), so concurrent pushes from different worktrees don't overwrite each other's output; logs past 4 days old are pruned on each run (`find -mtime +3` starts deleting at the 4-day mark, not 3). If that directory turns out to be unwritable, the hook falls back to a fixed path, then a throwaway `lifeos-prepush.XXXXXX` directory next to it, then (only if that templated `mktemp` call itself fails) a bare `mktemp -d`, which lands in a `tmp.XXXXXXXXXX`-style directory — and says so rather than blocking the push. A log found under any of those, or (as a last resort) directly under `/tmp`, means the configured directory was unusable that run. Any directory the hook doesn't own this way — the bare `/tmp` last resort, or a symlinked directory at any rung — gets a `lifeos-prepush-` filename prefix on its logs so they stay attributable, and is never tightened or swept; only a directory it owns is.
- **Server-free browser tests:** most browser tests point at a running `lifeos-api` and carry `requires_server` on top of `browser`. A browser test that serves `web/` itself on an ephemeral port and stubs every `/api/` call (see `tests/test_voice_mic_block_ui_browser.py`) omits that marker, so `browser and not requires_server` selects it. The pre-push hook runs that set alongside `unit and not slow` — it's the only gate that catches a `web/` JS regression before it reaches main, so prefer the self-contained pattern for new frontend tests.
- **Push over HTTPS, not SSH:** `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` points `origin`'s push URL at HTTPS (fetch stays SSH) because GitHub closes an idle SSH session after ~6 minutes while this ~9-minute gate is still running, which otherwise fails the push even after every test passed. If you push over SSH anyway, `scripts/pre-push` prints a one-line warning naming the HTTPS URL and keeps going.

## Server Management — CRITICAL

**NEVER run uvicorn or start the server directly.** Always use the provided scripts:

```bash
./scripts/server.sh start    # Start server (background)
./scripts/server.sh stop     # Stop server
./scripts/server.sh restart  # Restart after deploying code changes (never for isolated test runs)
./scripts/server.sh status   # Check if running
```

On Linux, services are managed by systemd (installed via `sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh`):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lifeos-api        # Restart API server
sudo systemctl status lifeos-api         # Check status
sudo systemctl status lifeos-chromadb    # Check ChromaDB
sudo systemctl status lifeos-llm         # Check local LLM (llama-server)
systemctl list-timers lifeos-*           # Check sync/watchdog timers
```

Restart the server after deploying Python changes because it does not auto-reload.
Isolated test runs never restart or stop a production server.

### Why This Matters

Running `uvicorn api.main:app` directly causes **ghost server processes**:

1. The script binds to `0.0.0.0:8000` (all interfaces including Tailscale)
2. Direct uvicorn often binds only to `127.0.0.1:8000` (localhost)
3. This creates TWO servers on different interfaces
4. User sees different behavior via localhost vs Tailscale/network
5. Code changes appear to "not work" because the wrong server handles requests

## Common Tasks

### Check Service Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/full | jq          # All endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health/services | jq      # External services
```

### Search for a Person

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/crm/people?q=Name" | jq '.people[0]'
```

### Run a Search Query

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "search terms", "top_k": 10}' | jq
```

### Trigger Vault Reindex

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex
```

### Run Manual Sync

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --dry-run     # Preview
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --execute --force  # Execute
```

### Debug Sync Issues

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --status
tail -50 logs/server.log    # Linux systemd (macOS launchd: logs/lifeos-api-error.log)
```

### Manage Tasks

```bash
# Create a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Review Q4 report", "context": "Work", "tags": ["review"]}' | jq

# List open tasks
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/tasks?status=todo" | jq

# Complete a task
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/{id}/complete | jq
```

### Google Workspace CLI (`gws`)

`gws` is the Google Workspace CLI — direct, typed access to Drive, Gmail, Sheets, and Calendar via the user's authenticated account. Useful for raw API calls the `lifeos_*` tools don't wrap (creating a Sheet, downloading a Drive file by id). Available to any agent with shell access (Claude Code, Codex).

```bash
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 10}'
gws gmail users messages list --params '{"userId": "me"}'
gws sheets spreadsheets get --params '{"spreadsheetId": "..."}'
gws schema drive.files.list          # discover params for any call
```

Prefer `lifeos_*` tools for search/synthesis; reach for `gws` for direct Google API calls.

## Operations Pointers

Operational procedures live in [guides/operations.md](docs/guides/operations.md): the Apple Data Agent (macOS export + FDA wrapper), Monarch Money re-auth, perf-tracing quick commands, and alerting severities. Perf/monitoring design: [specs/technical/observability.md](docs/specs/technical/observability.md).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Running uvicorn directly** → Use `./scripts/server.sh start`
2. **Forgetting to restart the deployed server after deploying code changes** → Use `./scripts/server.sh restart`; isolated test runs must not restart or stop a production server
3. **Committing without testing** → Use `./scripts/deploy.sh`
4. **Starting server on localhost only** → Must use 0.0.0.0 for Tailscale
5. **Overfitting to specific test cases** → Consider effects on the full system
6. **Breaking external chat clients** → See [client-surfaces.md](docs/specs/technical/client-surfaces.md) before editing chat/conversation routes or web SSE handling

## Documentation Rules (Quick Reference)

Full standards in [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md). Key rules:

- **Product specs** describe WHAT (consumer view). Implementation details go in `specs/technical/`.
- **ADRs are immutable.** To change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes.
- **Every doc** must have a Related Documents section with bidirectional links.
- **No task lists in specs.** Specs describe target state. Tasks go in `docs/plans/` or GitHub issues.
- **Synthetic data only** in all examples and test fixtures.
- **Completed plans** must be moved to `docs/plans/archive/`.
- **Current behavior only, everywhere.** Docs, code comments, docstrings, and test docstrings describe the system as it is — no "before/now", review rounds, findings, or issue/PR numbers cited as history. Git history holds that narrative.
