# Claude Code Configuration

## Workflow

- Use plan mode for non-trivial tasks (3+ files, architectural decisions, unclear requirements).
- After modifying docs, verify compliance with [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) standards.
- Production restarts belong to deployment; isolated test runs must not restart or stop a production server.
- When creating new directories or modules, check if an AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md pair is appropriate.

## Skills

Repo skills live in `.claude/skills/` and are surfaced automatically as slash commands (their descriptions come from each skill's own definition). These are LifeOS-specific — health checks, housekeeping, and reporting.

The development lifecycle comes from elsewhere: the user-scope `implement-lifecycle` and `issue-management` plugins, which read this repo's AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and `docs/` at runtime rather than carrying LifeOS knowledge of their own. `/implement <task>` is the primary entry point — full lifecycle: plan → implement → PR → adversarial review → merge. `/pr-check` and `/merge-pr` run standalone; review and follow-up are scoped invocations of `/implement` (`/implement <pr> just review`, `/implement <pr> address the review feedback`).

## Quick Reference

**Read these first:**
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — Full project reference (principles, invariants, key files, commands)
- [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) — Documentation standards
- [Development lifecycle](docs/specs/standards/development-lifecycle.md) — Shared risk, review, and verification contract

## Common Mistakes

The operational and documentation mistake lists live in AGENTS.md (§ Common Mistakes to Avoid, § Documentation Rules) and § Tests Are Sacred — imported above. The docs-hygiene items below aren't restated there:

1. **Creating monolithic docs** → Split by concern. Target line counts are in `docs/AGENTS.md`.
2. **Creating a `backlog.md` (or `todo.md`, `ideas.md`)** → Backlog lives in GitHub issues. Plan files are only for time-bounded execution notes for a specific in-flight effort.
3. **Over-documenting routine changes** → Not every change needs a docs update. Write what helps the next reader understand current state.
4. **Narrating changes in comments or docs** → describe current behavior; history lives in git.
