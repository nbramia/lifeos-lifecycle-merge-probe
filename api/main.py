WARNING: Do not run this file directly with uvicorn!
=========================================================
Always use the server management script:

    ./scripts/server.sh start    # Start server
    ./scripts/server.sh restart  # Restart after code changes
    ./scripts/server.sh stop     # Stop server

Running uvicorn directly can create ghost processes that bind to different
interfaces, causing localhost and Tailscale/network access to hit different
server instances with different code versions.

See CLAUDE.md for full instructions for AI coding agents.

# Load environment variables from .env file first, before any imports.
#
# The path is explicit (repo root, derived from this file's own location) —
# NOT a bare `load_dotenv()`. python-dotenv's default search (`usecwd=False`)
# walks upward from *this file's own directory* — not the process cwd —
# until it finds a `.env`, climbing all the way to the filesystem root if
# necessary. That's fine when this file lives in the real checkout (the
# first candidate found one level up IS the real checkout's own `.env`),
# but it's exactly the wrong behavior anywhere else this module gets
# imported from with no `.env` of its own (a git worktree, notably): the
# search keeps climbing past that directory and can load an unrelated,
# real `.env` from a parent — including another checkout's machine-specific
# config (see #598). Anchoring to `Path(__file__).parent.parent / ".env"`
# loads the exact same file as today for the real checkout (that first
# candidate IS the repo root there), so server behavior is unchanged, while
# a nested import (worktree, tests) only loads a `.env` that actually lives
# in that same checkout — never a parent's.
#
# Exception: an isolated test instance sets LIFEOS_TEST_INSTANCE=1 and must
# never source a real `.env`, even
# one that happens to exist at this path (e.g. a source snapshot built from
# a checkout that somehow still had one) — its own sanitized environment is

    """Additive sanity check for the `vault_search` row in `GET /health/full`
    (#762). Sample a handful of indexed file paths and confirm they still
    fall under the currently configured vault root, catching a moved/deleted
    vault whose index keeps serving stale content from the old location — a
    drift the base request/response probe (does search return results at
    all) can't see, since it only confirms search returns *something*.

    Mutates `vault_search_check` in place, downgrading an "ok" status to
    "degraded" and adding a `vault_root_check` field explaining the mismatch
    — the existing `detail` from the request/response probe (e.g. "1
    results") is left untouched, since that check is preserved unchanged
    and this is an additional signal, not a replacement. A no-op if the base
    check isn't present or didn't itself report "ok" — this never turns a
    failing check into a passing one, or vice versa, only adds a further
    downgrade on top of an already-passing result.

    If the sample comes back empty (no vault documents were sampled — e.g.
    a collection that is currently all non-vault content), that is absence
    of signal, not evidence of a moved vault, so the check stays "ok" with a
    neutral note instead of downgrading (#762 follow-up).

    Degrade rule (#762 second follow-up): the failure this check exists to
    catch is a vault that *moved* — in that case NO sampled vault path is
    under the configured root. A sample where some paths match and some
    don't isn't that failure; it's more likely stray debris (e.g. a test
    run that indexed documents straight into this collection, or a leftover
    path from an old sync) sitting alongside otherwise-healthy content. So
    this only downgrades to "degraded" when the sample contains at least one
    vault path and *none* of them are under the root. A partial mismatch
    stays "ok" but still surfaces a `vault_root_check` note (counts only)
    so it's visible without being alarming.
