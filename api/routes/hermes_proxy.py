"""Hermes text-backend proxy (#587) + persona/modality/turn envelope (#590, #591).

`/chat`'s third text backend: Hermes, an agent harness running as a gateway
(same box or reached over the tailnet), which speaks the same `/api/ask/stream`
SSE contract as LifeOS and the Agent backend. LifeOS proxies it at
``POST /api/hermes/ask/stream``, **adding the token server-side** so it never
reaches the browser. Empty ``LIFEOS_HERMES_BACKEND_URL`` disables it entirely —
`GET /api/hermes/status` then reports unavailable and `/chat` behaves exactly as
it does today.

Unlike the Agent backend, Hermes has no way to resolve a LifeOS persona id or
the current per-turn context (date/time, task tags, etc.) on its own, so this
route resolves both here and attaches the result to the forwarded body as a
`lifeos_context` envelope (the cross-repo contract pinned on issue #590,
extended with a `turn` sibling by #591) before forwarding. That means this
route buffers the request body instead of streaming it straight through — the
only place that happens among the text-backend proxies. The status/
bearer-injection/streaming-response logic is otherwise shared with the Agent
backend via `make_backend_router()` in `_proxy.py`.

#644: `POST /api/hermes/resolve-persona`, at the bottom of this module, is a
second, standalone entry point into the same persona resolution — for
Hermes's own Telegram front door, which never passes through the proxy above
(that would couple its Telegram availability to LifeOS being reachable).
Hermes calls it directly with the raw message text; both entry points share
`_resolve_lifeos_context()` so persona/voice/turn resolution has exactly one
implementation. See that section for the request/response contract, the
`@persona` selection grammar, and (a #644 follow-up) reply-thread persona
inheritance via `HermesPersonaThreadStore`
(`api/services/hermes_persona_thread_store.py`) and its companion
`POST /api/hermes/register-persona-message`.

#642 CROSS-REPO CONTRACT CHANGE: `lifeos_context.persona.orchestrates` can now
be `true` (previously always `false` — see `_build_envelope`'s comment on that
field). Its meaning has changed too: no longer "a LifeOS bug leaked an
orchestrating persona through, fail loudly" (the #590 contract's original
reading, back when the guard below made `true` impossible in practice) but
"this persona supervises workers through tools" — the intended path now that
#640 gives Hermes a real way to act on it. As of this writing, Hermes's
`lifeos_adapter/envelope.py` still raises `OrchestratingPersonaError` on
`true` (a fatal exception, not a warning) — tracked as `nbramia/hermes#57` to
make that informational instead. **This merge is gated on hermes#57 shipping
and deploying first**; landing this side alone would 500 every doctor turn on
Hermes rather than run one.

    through this proxy (which `/chat` reaches by default whenever Hermes is
    available) was relayed to Hermes and never captured at all — #674's gap,
    resurrected on a surface nobody had checked.

    Deliberately does NOT reuse `_build_envelope`'s own `parsed.persona_id or
    "primary"` shorthand (adversarial-review follow-up): that ignores a raw
    `persona` preamble entirely, which is exactly the shape `chat_via_api()`
    and the ring ingest send (issue #684 is what points those callers at
    this proxy) — approximating persona resolution that way would silently
    stop capturing a raw-preamble journal turn the moment #684 lands, the

    maps a raw `persona` the same way `ask_stream()` does, and rejects the
    same malformed shapes (`persona_id` and `persona` both set; an
    unrecognized/empty `persona_id`) with the same `HTTPException(400)` —
    raised here, before the backend is contacted, exactly like

    is contacted, so either exception means Hermes is never sent the turn —

    already uses for this identical raw body. A body that fails to parse or
    fails Pydantic validation here returns no frames rather than raising:
    `_build_envelope` (this router's `transform_body`) is what turns THAT
    kind of malformed body into a 400, and it runs on the same raw body

    """Read-only tee (#592, extended by #595) that reconstructs a Hermes turn
    from the bytes relayed to the browser and writes it to the conversation
    and usage stores, without altering, buffering, or delaying that relay.

    `_proxy.py`'s relay loop calls `observe()` with a copy of each chunk
    right *before* that chunk is handed to the browser, and calls
    `finalize()` exactly once when the relay ends — normal completion or an
    early disconnect alike. Hermes speaks the same SSE contract the native
    `/api/ask/stream` path emits (see api/routes/chat.py): `data: {...}\\n\\n`
    frames, a `conversation_id` event once, zero or more `content` events
    carrying incremental text, and at most one `usage` event carrying token
    counts, cost, and model. A chunk is a network read, not a frame, so
    frames can split across chunk boundaries — `observe()` reassembles them
    from a buffer rather than assuming one frame per chunk.

    `observe()` does no I/O: it only reassembles frames and buffers parsed
    text/usage data in memory (#592 review — a store call here, in the
    relay's per-chunk hot path, let a slow or locked db stall delivery of
    this stream's own next chunk; `ConversationStore._connect()`'s 10s busy
    timeout made that concrete). Every store write happens exactly once, in
    `finalize()`, after every byte of this turn has already been handed to
    the browser (or the client disconnected and no more are coming) — so a
    slow write can delay this request's own teardown but never one of its
    bytes.

    Every store call is wrapped: a persistence failure is logged and
    swallowed here so it can never surface as a broken turn.

    Usage capture (#595) shares this same observer rather than adding a
    second one over the same stream: the `usage` event's cost is recorded
    **verbatim**, never recomputed from the token counts — the cost
    calculator (`agent_worker/pricing.py`'s `cost_for`, #656) only knows
    Anthropic pricing and would misprice a non-Anthropic upstream model
    badly. A malformed or partial `usage` event (missing/wrong-typed model or
    token counts) is ignored rather than raised; a well-formed event with no
    `cost_usd` is recorded with a zero cost rather than an invented one.

    #611: `_proxy.py`'s pump now runs as a detached, registry-owned
    background task, so `finalize()` fires on the REAL end of the turn (the
    upstream connection closing) rather than on an early client disconnect —
    a disconnected browser no longer truncates what gets persisted here (see
    `bind_turn()`). What can still genuinely truncate a Hermes turn is the
    upstream connection itself ending before a `done` event ever arrived
    (Hermes crashed, was killed, or the connection dropped mid-turn) — this
    class can't tell that apart from an ordinary network hiccup on its own,
    so it tracks only whether `done` was observed and lets `finalize()`
    decide: seen it, persist verbatim (as always); never saw it, append
    `TRUNCATION_MARKER` and mark `routing.truncated` — the same visible
    signal the native path gives a cancelled/errored turn, via the same
    `truncation_routing()` helper.

# own Telegram front door, which never passes through the proxy above (that
# would couple its availability to LifeOS being up — see #658/#644's "two
# decisions already made"). Hermes instead calls this endpoint directly with
# the raw message text; the response tells it which persona (if any) was
# selected, the text with the selector stripped, and the same
# `lifeos_context` envelope `_build_envelope` above would attach for that
# persona — computed by the SAME `_resolve_lifeos_context` helper, so this
# and the proxy path can never resolve a persona differently.
#
# Resolution is an ORDERED rule, not a single check (#644 follow-up — reply-
# thread persona inheritance):
#   1. An explicit `@persona` prefix on this message wins, always — even
#      inside an existing persona thread, so replying with a new tag switches
#      personas mid-thread.
#   2. Else, if this message is a reply (Telegram's native reply-to) to a
#      message whose persona is known, inherit it.
#   3. Else, no persona — byte-identical to today.
# The mapping behind rule 2 (`HermesPersonaThreadStore`,
# api/services/hermes_persona_thread_store.py) is the one place that state
# lives, deliberately on the LifeOS side: putting it in Hermes would make
# persona resolution two-sourced again. `POST /api/hermes/register-persona-
# message`, below `resolve_persona_from_text`, is how Hermes anchors its OWN
# reply's message id to the same persona — needed because that id isn't
# known until after Hermes has already sent the reply to Telegram, which is
# necessarily after this endpoint already returned.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selection mechanism (Nathan's decision, documented in
# docs/specs/technical/client-surfaces.md): a per-message `@name` prefix, no
# persisted state — every message is judged independently. A tag is
# recognized only when it opens the message, the character right after `@`
# is a letter, and it's immediately followed by whitespace or the end of the
# message. Every configured persona id is `[a-z0-9_-]+` and, in practice,
# always letter-led (`_BOT_NAME_RE` in config/settings.py permits more, but
# no persona is actually named e.g. "123") — requiring a leading letter is a
# deliberate heuristic, not a hard technical constraint, chosen so an
# ordinary message that merely *starts* with `@` (a bare "@", "@3pm meeting",
# "@ what's up") is never mistaken for a tag attempt. Punctuation glued
# directly onto the tag (`@doctor,`) is likewise not recognized — the
# grammar matches the one documented form (`@doctor <message>`) rather than
# guessing at variants.
