"""
Journal ring ingestion endpoint (#660).

Lets a capture device outside the tailnet — the Pebble Index ring is the
motivating case, transcribing speech on-phone and posting the text — feed
fragments into the `journal` persona built in #659. It intentionally does
NOT reimplement capture: `_ingest_fragment` below calls the exact same chat
pipeline entry point (`api.services.telegram.chat_via_api`, with the journal
persona's preamble) that the journal Telegram bot uses for a typed fragment,
so a spoken fragment gets identical treatment — same log file, same task/
schedule thresholds, same ask-when-unsure behavior. Since #674 that pipeline
writes the fragment to `Personal/Log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` deterministically, in code,
and reports back that it did; this endpoint requires that confirmation before
it calls a delivery captured.

Our own contract (see docs/guides/journal-ring-ingest.md) — the exact shape a
real Pebble Index webhook sends is unknown until the device ships in March
2026 (issue #660 is explicit: build against a contract we control, adapt when
the device is in hand). `_adapt_payload` is the ONLY function that knows the
request body's shape; if a real device's webhook doesn't match, only that
function should need to change.

Auth mirrors the existing bearer-token ingest pattern (`api/routes/fitness.py`
`_check_ingest_auth`, itself modeled on the MCP HTTP transport's
`LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`): a dedicated token, 503 while unset, 401 on a
missing/wrong bearer, checked BEFORE the body is parsed so an unauthenticated
caller can't probe validation behavior or cause any write.
