Journal trend views: the strip, the unexplored wheel, and the scalar stack
(issue follow-up to #212).

The original emotion wheel (`api/routes/journal.py`) answers "what did I
feel most often" for a single window. Operator feedback on that view was
that it says nothing about *trajectory* — and with 32 entries spanning
2026-01-27 to 2026-06-22 in three bursts (Jan-Feb, April, June) rather than
a steady cadence, "trajectory" mostly means "how sparse and clustered is
this, actually" before anything else. These views are the response; see
docs/specs/product/journal-analytics.md for the full writeup, including
options considered and rejected.

A fourth view — felt-vs-recorded connection, which cross-referenced
`connection_<name>` self-reports against `data/interactions.db` via
`api.services.entity_resolver` — was removed after operator feedback that
it wasn't useful (see the spec's Removed section). Removing it also
dropped this module's only reason to import the entity resolver or touch
the interactions database, which shrinks this module's privacy surface —
a real gain, not just a line-count one.

This is a separate module from `journal.py` rather than an extension of it
because the unexplored wheel pulls in a data source the original wheel
never needed — `data/gsheet_sync.db` — and `journal.py` at 372 lines
before this file existed was already a full unit on its own. Splitting
keeps the wheel's import surface untouched.

Deliberately reuses rather than reimplements, per the issue's explicit
instruction:
- `api.routes.journal.window_bounds` / `_canonical_window` — the same
  day/week/month/quarter/all-time semantics as the wheel.
- `api.routes.journal._iter_valid_journal_files` / `collect_window` — the
  same symlink-safe, filename-is-canonical, UTF-8-safe file walk.
- `api.routes.journal._is_plausible_label` / `_display_value` — the same
  value-disclosure shape policy, applied here to the taxonomy labels
  extracted from the Google Sheet's column names (view B) as a defense-in
  depth measure, even though that source is form structure rather than
  journal free text.
- `api.routes.journal.parse_emotion_chain` — reused a second time in this
  module (beyond the strip) to derive the unexplored wheel's primary-emotion
  grouping from real observed chains; see `_derive_branch_groups`.

None of these are re-exported as a public API of this module; the imports
below are intentionally of the underscore-prefixed originals, because
duplicating the logic under a second name would be exactly the
reinvention the issue asked to avoid.

`resonant_moment` (free-text, the most sensitive field in the file) and
`one_word` are never read here, matching the wheel's existing boundary.

# and its many circulated derivatives) this operator's Google Form is
# itself derived from — NOT measured from this operator's private data,
# and strictly separable from `_derive_branch_groups`'s vote-counting
# below. `_group_for_label` only consults this map when a branch is
# neither a known primary itself nor covered by any real observed chain;
# derived evidence always wins when both have an opinion (see
# `_group_for_label`), and `_find_grouping_conflicts` exists specifically
# to catch — and log loudly, never silently swallow — the case where they
# disagree.
#
# This map exists because grouping-by-observed-evidence-alone is
# self-defeating for exactly the view it's meant to serve: a branch is
# only ever observed if it was selected, but the unexplored wheel exists
# to show branches that were *never* selected. On one real vault's data,
# leaving grouping purely evidence-based left 25 of 47 branches (53%)
# unplaced — the branches the view is about are precisely the ones with
# no evidence, so no amount of vote-counting over real chains was ever

#
# Necessarily incomplete and not authoritative for every rendition of the
# wheel in circulation — some words appear more than once across
# different published versions of it (e.g. "Overwhelmed" under both
# Fearful and Bad's branches in different renderings); where that
# happened during construction, one primary was picked and is noted
# inline. A branch this map doesn't cover, and that also has no observed
# evidence, still lands in `_UNPLACED_GROUP` — this is a fallback, not a
# guarantee of full coverage, and an honest gap beats a wrong guess here

    explicit: the strip should auto-scale to the full history available —
    leftmost cell is the earliest recorded observation, rightmost is today
    — not whatever window happens to be selected elsewhere on the page.
    An earlier version took `window` and used the wheel's day/week/month/

    explicitly and never sends `?window=` to this endpoint, so a reader
    changing the window pill and watching this section not move reads as
    intentional, not broken.

    "Earliest recorded observation" means the earliest entry
    `_iter_valid_journal_files` actually admits — canonical `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
    filename, not a symlink, UTF-8, parseable frontmatter, and (if present)
    a `date:` field that agrees with the filename — never the earliest
    file on disk regardless of whether it parses. A malformed or

    Every day gets a cell in one of three distinct states — never just two:

    - **Gap** (`has_entry: false`) — no journal file that day at all.
    - **Entry, no feeling** (`has_entry: true, primary_emotion: null`) — a

    An earlier pass at this grouping assumed the form's `"<Node> feelings"`
    columns are laid out depth-first, so column order alone would reveal
    the tree. That assumption is false: in form order, `Playful` (index 29)
    comes immediately before `Happy` (index 30), even though `Playful` is
    one of `Happy`'s children in the standard wheel this form derives
    from. Order reflects however the form's author arranged the questions,
    not the tree structure, so it is never used here.

    What *is* reliable: every parsed emotion chain (`parse_emotion_chain`)
    is a real parent -> child path an entry actually recorded, e.g.
    `["Sad", "Muted", "Not sure"]` means "Muted" followed "Sad" and
    "Not sure" followed "Muted" in that one entry. This function walks
    every chain from every journal entry ever written — deliberately not
    window-scoped, since which primary a branch belongs to is a structural
    property of the form, not something that should shift depending on
    which time window happens to be selected — and, for every non-root
    value in a chain, casts a vote for the chain's root (`chain[0]`) as
    that value's primary. A branch's group is whichever root has the most
    votes; ties break alphabetically for determinism.

    "Not sure" chains are never used as evidence in either direction: a
    chain rooted at "Not sure" casts no votes (skipped outright), and
    "Not sure" appearing anywhere inside another chain is never itself
    recorded as a branch to be grouped (see `_EXCLUDED_VALUE` — it is
    excluded from the wheel entirely, so it needs no group). A root that
    isn't one of `_KNOWN_PRIMARIES` at all (which should not happen with a
    trustworthy chain, but a hand-edited entry could produce one) also
    casts no votes, rather than inventing an eighth primary on the fly.

    Returns only entries this function found votes for. A branch with no
    votes at all — never observed as a non-root value in any real chain —
    is absent from the returned dict; the caller (`_group_for_label`) then
    falls back to `_PUBLISHED_TAXONOMY_MAP` before finally landing on
    `_UNPLACED_GROUP`. A branch that is itself one of `_KNOWN_PRIMARIES`
    doesn't need a vote to find its group at all — the caller checks that
    case first — but if one somehow received contrary votes anyway (real
    data quirk, not expected), those votes are still returned here; the
    caller's primary-name check takes precedence over anything in this
    dict.
