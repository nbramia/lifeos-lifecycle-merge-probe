"""Kanban board view-model helpers for `/agents` (#850).

Pure functions only — no I/O, no vault or scheduler access — so lane
derivation and lane-move planning can be unit-tested exhaustively against the
lane table in issue #850 without a TaskManager or SchedulerStore fixture.
`api/routes/agents.py` wires these against the real stores and stays thin:
it reads a task/schedule entry, calls into this module for the *decision*,
then performs the write. See docs/specs/technical/agent-viz.md.

Lanes are derived from task status + tags on every read — there is no stored
lane field anywhere in the vault or the task index.
