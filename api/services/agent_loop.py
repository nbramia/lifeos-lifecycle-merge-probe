"""
Agentic chat loop for LifeOS.

Runs a multi-turn conversation where the model can call tools
autonomously. Implemented as an async generator that yields events so the
caller (SSE endpoint) can stream them to the client in real time.

Uses the local LLM (OpenAI-compatible llama-server) by default.

Event types yielded:
  {"type": "turn_state", "result": AgentResult} -- live, mutable accumulator
                                                     (first event; #615)
  {"type": "text",   "content": "..."}       -- streamed text chunk
  {"type": "status", "message": "..."}       -- tool execution status
  {"type": "self_correction"}                -- model retrying (consumers should clear buffered text)
  {"type": "result", "result": AgentResult}  -- final result (last event)

    """
    Async generator that runs the agentic chat loop.

    Yields events as they happen so the caller can stream them.

    Args:
        question: The user's current question.
        conversation_history: Previous messages (list of Message objects with .role, .content).
        attachments: Optional file attachments (list of dicts with filename, media_type, data).
        model_tier: "haiku", "sonnet", or "opus" (ignored for local model, kept for API compat).
        max_tool_rounds: Max number of tool-use rounds before forcing a text response.
        model: Optional Anthropic model id override for this turn (escalation, #303).
            When set on the Anthropic backend, the turn runs on a dedicated
            AnthropicLLMClient with this model instead of the default singleton.
            Ignored on the local backend.
        persona: Optional per-bot system-prompt preamble (e.g. the fitness bot).
            Empty for the default chat surface.
        voice_rules: The selected persona's spoken-response rules, appended to the
            system prompt only on voice turns (empty for text turns).
        force_local: Run this turn on the local (llama-server / Gemma) backend
            even when the global backend is Anthropic — the chat model picker's
            "Gemma (local)" option. Builds a per-turn LocalLLMClient.
        force_remote: Run this turn on the configured paid OpenAI-compatible
            remote provider (#654) — the chat model picker's explicit "Remote"
            option. Builds a per-turn LocalLLMClient pointed at
            settings.remote_llm_*. Usage is priced from the configured rates
            (or marked unpriced if none are set) instead of the free-local
            assumption the rest of this module makes.

    Yields:
        Dicts with "type" key: "turn_state" (first event, #615 -- a live
        reference to the mutable AgentResult, for a caller that needs
        accrued usage before the loop reaches its terminal event; #629
        extends what "accrued so far" means -- see AgentResult's
        provisional_input_tokens/provisional_output_tokens), "text",
