# Email send gate (draft → confirm → send)

# Per-turn set of draft IDs created during the current agent turn. The agent
# loop binds a fresh set at the start of each user turn (begin_email_send_turn);
# create_email_draft adds to it and send_email_draft refuses to send anything
# in it. This makes "draft first, get confirmation, then send" a STRUCTURAL
# guarantee rather than a prompt-only instruction — a freshly drafted email
# cannot be sent in the same turn even if the model tries to. A ContextVar
# (not a module global) keeps concurrent requests on the shared API isolated:
# each request runs in its own task/context with its own set.
#
# This in-memory check is stricter and cheaper than the ledger (no I/O, exact
# per-turn membership) so it stays as the first layer. But it is ALSO only
# ever consulted by this process's own tool calls — it cannot see a draft
# created via HTTP, and a draft it creates is invisible to any other caller
# (including the HTTP send endpoint). So both tools additionally go through
# api.services.gmail_draft_ledger.check_send_gate(), the same choke point the
# HTTP route uses, before reaching GmailService.send_draft() (#588).

# create_email_draft in this turn is recorded with the same id a later-turn

# for callers that share a process instead of a request.

      `error_details` instead.
