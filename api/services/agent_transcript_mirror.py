"""Mirrors Claude Code / Codex transcripts from registered remote hosts.

Local `cli_sessions` rows (posted by `scripts/lifeos-agent-hook.sh`) give a
remote session status and a prompt preview, but nothing else — token counts,
cost, tool calls, and the transcript feed only exist for a transcript this
API host can read off its own disk. This module closes that gap: a
background loop periodically rsyncs each registered host's Claude Code and
Codex transcript directories into a per-host mirror on this box, read-only,
so `api/routes/agents.py`'s snapshot builder can ingest them exactly like a
local transcript and merely stamp the result with the remote host's name.

Layout: `<mirror_root>/<host>/claude_code/` and `<mirror_root>/<host>/codex/`,
one subtree per host in `settings.agent_hosts`, mirroring the source
directory structure (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/*.jsonl` and
`~/.codex/sessions/<y>/<m>/<d>/rollout-*.jsonl`) so the existing
`session_ingest.discover_sessions()` scanners work unmodified against a
mirrored root.

Public surface:
- `mirror_root()` / `host_dirs(host)` — path helpers.
- `mirror_host(host, ssh_target, ...)` — one host's incremental pull.
- `mirror_once(...)` — every registered host, concurrently.
- `start()` / `stop()` — the background interval loop (wired into
  `api/main.py`'s lifespan next to `agent_viz_summary_prefetch`).
- `mirrored_snapshot()` — `(cc_rows, cx_rows, edges)` for every mirrored host.
- `mirrored_transcript_dirs(engine)` — per-host dirs for the events/stream/
  focus lookups in `api/routes/agents.py`.

Constraints: ssh + rsync only, no new dependencies; read-only
on the remote (never `--delete` on the remote side, never push); an
unreachable host must not delay or break any other host's mirror tick.
