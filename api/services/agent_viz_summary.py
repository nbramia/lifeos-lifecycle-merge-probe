"""Per-session "what did this agent work on?" summaries for the /agents UI.

Extracts a small context window from a session's transcript — the first user
message, the final assistant message, and any PR titles/URLs mentioned — and
asks the local Gemma LLM to produce two outputs:

    short_label: 2-6 word node label
    summary:     1-2 sentence / bullet recap

Results are cached by (session_id, last_activity_at) so a session that hasn't
moved doesn't re-summarize on every panel open or snapshot tick.

    `label` is routinely the row's own raw identifier (a session id, a
    "cc:"/"cx:"-prefixed id, or a bare task id) when there's no real title —
    every ingest and `_label_for_session` fall back to exactly that. The
    tokenizer below treats '-'/'_' as continuation characters, so a whole
    uuid or `t-...` task id matches as a single "word" and comes back
    byte-for-byte; a colon-prefixed id like "cx:remote-cx-1" comes back as
    a trivial re-spacing ("cx remote-cx-1") instead. Neither is a real
    label — it's the identifier itself, cosmetically reformatted.

    An identifier has no word boundaries of its own; a genuine human title
    already carries real whitespace in `label`. So: if the original label
    had no whitespace, treat *any* tokenized result as suspect and return
    ""  instead, so the caller (`web/agents/graph.js`'s `nodeLabel`) falls
    through to a real candidate like `model_label` rather than rendering
    the id back at the operator. Accepted cost: a legitimate one-word
    Latin title (`'Refactor'`, `'Q4-roadmap'`) also returns "" — the graph
    node is unaffected (it falls through to the identical `label`), but
    the panel's short-label row renders blank and `search_cached_summaries`
    loses coverage for those rows. Deliberate, not a bug.

    The tokenizer is ASCII-only ([A-Za-z0-9] word starts), so a genuinely
    non-empty, non-Latin title (CJK, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, emoji-only)
    also produces zero tokens — the same shape as "no title at all". Those
    two cases must not share an exit: a non-empty input that merely
    tokenized to nothing still has a real title sitting in `label` for the
    caller to fall through to, so it returns "" like the no-whitespace
    case above. "Untitled" is reserved for a genuinely empty/whitespace-
    only `label`, where there is no real title to fall through to: since
    "Untitled" outranks `label` in `nodeLabel`'s precedence, returning it
