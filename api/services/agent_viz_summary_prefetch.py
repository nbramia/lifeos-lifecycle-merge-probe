"""Background worker that pre-computes /agents session summaries.

The lazy click-on-demand model (api/services/agent_viz_summary.py) means a
fresh first view spends ~25-30s in Gemma. This worker walks the snapshot
between user actions, summarizes any session that doesn't have a cached
short_label yet, and yields when the agent worker is actively using Gemma —
so a node label is usually ready by the time the operator looks.

Disabled by default in tests; enabled via LIFEOS_AGENT_VIZ_PREFETCH_ENABLED.
