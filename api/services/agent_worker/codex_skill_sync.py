"""Materialize LifeOS skills into Codex's local skill format.

LifeOS skills live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and are authored in
Claude Code's slash-command dialect: YAML frontmatter with `argument-hint`, a
`$ARGUMENTS` placeholder, and `` !`cmd` `` bash-injection blocks in the Context
section. The portable subset is converted into Codex's plain `SKILL.md` format
and installed into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (or `~/.codex/skills`) for local Codex
sessions and the LifeOS Codex worker.

This module converts the portable subset (no Claude subagent orchestration)
to Codex's format and installs them. It is import-safe and side-effect-free
until an install function is called, so transforms can be unit-tested
without touching the filesystem.

Only engine-agnostic skills are ported. `mine-for-ideas` drives Claude's
`Task`/`Skill` subagent loop and is deliberately left Claude-only; `tune` edits
the LifeOS Claude-orchestrator internals and is also excluded.

The implementation lifecycle (planning, issue drafting, PR checks, review,
merge) is not synced from here at all: it comes from the
`benjamcalvin/bootstraps` marketplace, which ships a Codex-compatible plugin
(`implement-lifecycle`, `issue-management`) installed through Codex's own
plugin browser.

      pre-expanded. Done before the `$ARGUMENTS` swap so a command containing
      `$ARGUMENTS` isn't corrupted mid-rewrite.

      the same way — the user's request *is* the argument.
