"""Inter-agent coordination tools (`lifeos_agent_*` family).

These tools let an in-flight agent session spawn, message, and coordinate with
other agent sessions — turning the worker into a multi-agent supervisor. The
core primitives are:

  - **spawn**: create a child session (Claude or local) with budget drawn from
    the caller's lineage budget. Returns immediately with a `child_session_id`.
  - **send**: append a user-role message to a peer/child session. For yielded
    sessions, the message is queued for the next resume. Sending to your own
    completed CLI child reopens it (the message becomes its next turn, resumed
    with full prior context) — the answer path for a child that completed with
    a "[needs clarification]" question (#356 follow-up).
  - **check**: non-blocking status snapshot of any session.
  - **yield_until**: terminate the caller's session until specified children
    reach a terminal state; on resume, children's outputs are injected as a
    new user turn. The primary coordination primitive — avoids idle billing
    on Managed Agents.
  - **kill**: terminate a descendant session.
  - **transcript_read**: read the JSONL transcript of any session.
  - **sessions_list**: filtered listing of recent sessions.

This module exposes the tools as plain Python functions taking an `InterAgentContext`
that bundles the worker's stores + caller's session_id. The `ToolRegistry`
(local executor) and `mcp_server.py` (managed agents) both wrap these into
tool definitions.

Security model: no-sandbox per AGENTS.md. The MCP-side wrapping passes
`caller_session_id` as a parameter — operators trust their own agents.

    The `claude_code` / `codex` executors run a `subprocess.Popen` in the

    / `codex_pid` transcript event (the subprocess is its own session leader via

    can only reach that subprocess by signalling the recorded pgid. Same-user
    `killpg` is permitted; the worker's `proc.wait()` reaps the dead child.

    A session whose `host` names a machine other than the API host never

    branch, which appends that event with the local ssh client's own
    `proc.pid` regardless of whether the pgid line ever arrived). Falling
    through to the local pid path is what makes that hang killable.
