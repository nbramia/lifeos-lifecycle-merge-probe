"""HTTP wrapper for Anthropic Managed Agents — the Claude-routed execution path.

Managed Agents (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview,
launched April 2026) hosts the agent loop on Anthropic's infrastructure. The
**Agent** preset (model, system prompt, MCP servers, tools, skills) and
**Environment** (where tool calls execute) are configured once in the
Anthropic console and referenced by ID. Per-task, we just create a Session
that points at an agent + environment, then push the task description as
the initial user message.

This module is intentionally minimal:
- Polling-based state consumption (not SSE) — simpler to drive from the
  single-threaded worker loop, easier to test, recoverable across restarts.
- All HTTP calls go through an injectable `httpx.Client` so tests use
  `MockTransport` and never hit the live API.
- Required headers split: `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` AND
  `anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01`. The beta header is its own
  header (it is not folded into the version header).

API surface (verbatim from the Managed Agents docs):
- `POST /v1/sessions` — body: `{agent, environment_id, vault_ids, metadata?, title?}`,
  returns `{id, ...}`.
- `GET  /v1/sessions/{id}` — returns current session state (status + cumulative usage
  + recent events; events are the primary terminal-state signal).
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events` — body: `{events: [{type: "user.message", content: [{type: "text", text}]}]}`.
  Used to post the initial user message and any follow-up turns (e.g. Telegram clarification answers).
- `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}` — terminate a session early (budget breach / cascade-kill).

        params as `created_at[gt|gte|lt|lte], limit, order, page, types[]`.
        The docs' canonical pattern for "give me events newer than X" is to

        arrive in chronological order, then filter to ids strictly greater
        than `after_id`. Event IDs are ULIDs (`sevt_…`) which sort
        lexicographically by time, so a string compare gives the right
        ordering without parsing.

        Trade-off: each poll re-fetches the full event history. Anthropic's
        per-org rate limit is 600 read/min so this is fine at LifeOS's
        scale; if a session ever produces enough events that the re-fetch
