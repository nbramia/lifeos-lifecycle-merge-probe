"""Routes a task to the appropriate executor based on preflight output.

Issue C wires only the `local` branch. `claude` rolls the tag back to
`#agent` and logs; Issue D adds the managed-agents driver and finishes the
wiring. `ask` is handled before routing by the worker — preflight returns
`routing="ask"` and the worker sends a clarification + parks the task as
`#agent-blocked` without ever invoking the router.
