"""Per-class tool filter helper (#139 §3, partial).

The full per-class session tool filtering flow is:
  1. Preflight picks `preset_class` (personal-comm / work-comm / research /
     financial / crm / fullstack)
  2. Worker creates the session as usual
  3. Worker calls `driver.update_session()` with the filtered tool list
  4. Filtered tools scope the cache_creation cost on the first user turn

This module owns step 3's input: given a class name, return the right
`{tools: [...], mcp_servers: [...]}` payload for the UPDATE call. The
worker-side wiring (steps 2 + 3) is a follow-up; this helper lands now
so the rest can compose against a tested, documented surface.

Cross-cutting tools are auto-merged into every class's filter — every
agent needs at minimum: telegram_send, agent_* coordination, search,
ask, health, task_*, reminder_*, and calendar reads.
