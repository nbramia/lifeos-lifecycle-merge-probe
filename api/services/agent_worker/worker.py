"""Main poll loop for the LifeOS agent worker.

Per-tick flow:
  - wake any sessions whose sleep timer has expired
  - check the daily spend cap
  - list todo/urgent tasks carrying an engine assignee (or Managed Agents
    consent tag) from the API
  - for each unclaimed candidate: claim with `#agent-running`, preflight, route
    (local → run on Gemma; claude → Managed Agents; ask/ambiguous → block)
  - on terminal outcomes, swap to the matching #agent-* status tag and
    notify via Telegram

The worker is a stand-alone process (`python -m api.services.agent_worker.worker`)
managed by the `lifeos-agent-worker.service` systemd unit. It does not import
the FastAPI app — all task ops go through `/api/tasks`. This keeps the worker
trivially restartable and lets the API enforce its own locking.
