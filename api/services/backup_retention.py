"""Tiered backup retention for SQLite database snapshots.

A backup file is kept iff it is the newest one falling into any of these
buckets:

- The N most recent backups (the **daily** tier, ``daily_keep``) — always kept.
- 1 per week-of-age between ``daily_keep`` and ``weekly_horizon_days``.
- 1 per month-of-age between ``weekly_horizon_days`` and ``monthly_horizon_days``.
- 1 per quarter (~3 months) of age beyond ``monthly_horizon_days``.

At the defaults (5 / 35 / 365 day boundaries), steady state is roughly:

  5 daily + 4 weekly + 11 monthly + ~4/year quarterly ≈ 25 files growing
  linearly afterwards. Each backup is a full copy of the source DB.

The helper is intentionally parameterised by ``db_basename`` so other
stores (``crm.db``, ``sync_health.db``, …) can reuse the same retention
policy without copy-pasting the bucket math. Issue #227.

Filename convention
-------------------

The writer (``backup_filename``) and the pruner (``prune``) share a single
naming scheme: ``<basename>.<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.backup``. Files that don't
match this exact pattern are ignored — operators sometimes drop in
hand-rolled names like ``interactions.db.pre-upgrade.backup`` for manual
safekeeping; retention should leave those alone.
