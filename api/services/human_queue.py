"""Human queue: fire-and-forget cards any agent can file for the operator (#852).

A human-queue card is a task (`api/services/task_manager.py`) with tag
`human` and status `blocked` ("open"). This module is the single place that
knows the card shape (`fields`: `key`, `source_host`, `source_cwd`,
`source_session`, `done_when`) and its dedupe/resolve rules, so the REST
routes (`api/routes/tasks.py`) and the native chat tool (`api/services/
agent_tools.py`) both agree on it. The morning briefing surfaces open cards
by calling the native chat tool's `list` action directly, the same way
`/chat` does, rather than through a helper here. The worker's `done_when`
poll tick (`api/services/agent_worker/worker.py`) talks to this queue over
the HTTP API instead — see that module for why.

`done_when` is stored as a compact JSON string in the `done_when` field
(fields values may not contain a newline or `<!--`, but JSON free of those
round-trips cleanly through the markdown task line — see
`task_manager._validate_text_fields`).
