"""Redaction of secrets and personal data from log records.

The Telegram Bot API embeds the bot token directly in the request path
(``https://api.telegram.org/bot<digits>:<secret>/<method>``). ``httpx``'s
request logger defaults to INFO and logs the full URL of every request —
which is how a live, full-control credential ended up in plaintext in
``logs/server.log`` and ``logs/sync.log``.

This module provides two layers of defense:

1. ``silence_noisy_http_loggers()`` — the direct fix. Raises the relevant
   HTTP client loggers to WARNING so a *successful* send never logs the URL
   (and therefore the token) in the first place.
2. ``TelegramTokenRedactionFilter`` / ``install_telegram_redaction_filter()``
   — a defensive backstop. Installed on the root logger's handlers, it
   rewrites any log record whose rendered message contains a Telegram bot
   token shape, so a future library, log level change, or code path (e.g. an
   httpx exception whose string form embeds the request URL) can't
   reintroduce the leak even if the level-based fix above is bypassed.

Call ``configure_telegram_log_redaction()`` once per process, after the
process's own root logging setup (``logging.basicConfig`` or equivalent) has
run — it needs at least one handler already attached to root for the filter
to have something to attach to.

A third, unrelated filter lives here too for the same reason: uvicorn's own
access logger (``uvicorn.access``) writes the full request line — path *and*
query string — for every request, at INFO, regardless of what any route
handler logs, so the raw text typed into the CRM search box
(``GET /api/crm/people?q=<text>``) reaches ``logs/server.log`` even though
the CRM people-list handler's own log line doesn't name it — a gap no
handler-level fix can close, since a handler only ever sees the parsed
query parameter, never the access logger's own line.
``RequestQueryStringRedactionFilter`` / ``install_query_string_redaction_filter()``
strip everything from the first ``?`` onward in that line, for every route,
not just this one.
