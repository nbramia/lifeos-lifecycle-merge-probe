"""Model readout (#658) — which model is actually serving each chat surface,
right now.

Two upstream failures motivated this: hermes#49 mistook a stale tracked
config snapshot for the live value, and hermes#50 had two surfaces answering
with materially different competence and nobody told. Both were
**invisibility**, not disagreement — this module answers "what's live" by
asking the actual running process, or observing what actually happened,
never by re-reading a config file:

- LifeOS native picker, Anthropic backend: `settings.anthropic_model` IS the
  live value here — it's read straight out of this process's own in-memory
  settings (the same object every request already uses), not re-parsed off
  disk. There's no separate Anthropic process on this box that could be
  running a different model out from under that setting.
- LifeOS native picker, local backend: `settings.local_llm_model` is only a
  declared intent — llama-server serves one model per process and can be
  restarted against a different one without this setting changing (exactly
  the tracked-snapshot-vs-live mismatch hermes#49 hit), so it's confirmed
  with a live probe instead of trusted.
- LifeOS native picker, remote backend (#771): `settings.remote_llm_model`
  IS the live value, same reasoning as the Anthropic bullet above — it's
  the exact model id `get_local_llm()` builds the singleton client with,
  not a value that could drift out from under this process the way a
  restarted external llama-server could.
- Hermes chat: `LIFEOS_HERMES_BACKEND_URL` (confirmed live on the real host,
  #658 review) points at LifeOS's own hermes-lifeos-adapter, not the Hermes
  gateway itself — the adapter has no `/v1/models` (or any capability
  endpoint) to probe, and even if it did, a capability probe answers "what
  COULD serve a turn", not "what DID": the adapter's `hermes_model` config
  (or a per-turn `model_hint`) can pick a different model per request, so a
  single "current capability" value would misrepresent turns that overrode
  it. The only trustworthy signal is the model Hermes itself *reported*
  serving a turn with, in that turn's own `usage` event — observed, not
  declared. `api/routes/hermes_proxy.py`'s `_HermesTurnPersister` already
  parses that event for every real Hermes chat turn; `record_hermes_chat_turn_model`
  below is its write side, called the moment a turn's usage event validates.
  "unknown" until this process has relayed at least one such turn.
- Hermes Telegram: Hermes's Telegram bot talks to the Hermes gateway
  directly, bypassing LifeOS entirely — by design, so Hermes's Telegram
  path stays independent of LifeOS uptime (see client-surfaces.md). That
  means LifeOS never sees a single byte of that traffic: not a config, not
  a probe, not an observed turn. Reported as "not_observable" — a status
  distinct from "unknown" ("tried to find out, couldn't") because there is
  no attempt to fail here, only an acknowledged structural blind spot. A
  borrowed value from hermes_chat would be dishonest: the adapter's
  `hermes_model`/`model_hint` machinery means the two CAN genuinely differ
  per turn (this is exactly the hermes#50 shape — two surfaces, potentially
  different competence — so asserting they match would recreate the same
  invisibility this readout exists to end, just with more confidence).

Every surface reports `{"status": "ok" | "unknown" | "not_configured" |
"not_observable", "model": str | None, ...}`. "unknown" is the deliberate
answer when a surface can't be confirmed — never falling back to whatever's
configured, which would repeat hermes#49's mistake in a different place.

Never returns a credential. `_probe_live_model` sends the bearer token it's
given (used only for the local-backend probe path today, which has no
credential) but never echoes it, logs it, or includes it in a returned
value.
