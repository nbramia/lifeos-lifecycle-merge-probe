"""
Relationship Metrics - Compute relationship strength scores.

Relationship strength is computed using the formula:
    strength = (recency × RECENCY_WEIGHT) + (frequency × FREQUENCY_WEIGHT) + (diversity × DIVERSITY_WEIGHT)

Where:
- recency: max(0, 1 - days_since_last/RECENCY_WINDOW_DAYS)
- frequency: min(1, weighted_interactions/FREQUENCY_TARGET)
- diversity: unique_sources / total_sources

Interaction weights are applied per source_type (e.g., imessage=1.5, gmail=0.8).
See config/relationship_weights.py for all weights.
