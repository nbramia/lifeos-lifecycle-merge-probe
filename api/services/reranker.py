"""
Cross-encoder re-ranking service for LifeOS.

Uses a cross-encoder model to re-rank search results by computing
query-document relevance scores. Much more accurate than bi-encoder
similarity because it sees query and document together.

## How It Works

Cross-encoders differ from bi-encoders:
- Bi-encoder: Embed query and document separately, compute similarity
- Cross-encoder: Process (query, document) pair together for direct relevance

This allows cross-encoders to catch nuances that bi-encoders miss,
like negation, specificity, and contextual relevance.

## Usage

    from api.services.reranker import get_reranker
    reranker = get_reranker()
    reranked = reranker.rerank(query, results, top_k=10)
