"""
Web search service for LifeOS.

Real web search on every LLM backend. The search itself runs in LifeOS via
DuckDuckGo (no API key), so it works identically whether the orchestrator is on
Anthropic, Codex, or the local llama-server. On the Anthropic backend we upgrade
to Claude's native server-side web search (iterative, cited) for higher quality.

Both entry points degrade honestly: a failed or empty search returns nothing to
say (empty results / empty answer), never a fabricated "from my training data"
response — that stub behavior is exactly what this module replaces.
