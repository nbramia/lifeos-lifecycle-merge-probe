        Same registry source as Telegram, so ``persona_id="fitness"`` yields the
        exact preamble the fitness Telegram bot uses. ``"primary"`` resolves to
        an empty preamble (the default, no persona). Returns ``None`` for an
        unknown id so the caller can reject it with HTTP 400.

        ``surface`` selects a surface-specific variant of the body when one
        exists — e.g. ``surface="hermes"`` for a persona whose execution model
        differs on the Hermes harness (MCP tools, no shell) from Telegram/web
        (a headless Claude Code session). See ``_surface_variant_body``.
        Omitted (the default, ``None``), every caller — including every one
        that predates this parameter — gets exactly today's body; a persona
        with no variant for the requested surface also gets exactly today's
        body, so this is additive until a variant file exists.
