# ADR-007: Linux Migration and Local LLM Orchestration

**Status:** Complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-27
**Decision:** Accepted
**Supersedes:** [ADR-005](005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md) — TCC rationale no longer applies; external venv practice retained by convention.
**Amended by:** [ADR-009](009-llm-backend-toggle.md) — The local-first orchestrator default became an operator-configurable toggle.

## Context

LifeOS was running on a Mac Mini (macOS) as its primary server, with all AI orchestration (agentic chat loop, RAG synthesis) handled by the Claude API. This architecture worked but had growing limitations:

1. **Compute ceiling**: The Mac Mini lacked GPU resources for running large local models. Growing interest in local LLM orchestration (for privacy, cost, and latency) required hardware with significant VRAM — at least 96GB to run a 120B-parameter model.

2. **Cost accumulation**: Every agentic chat interaction required multiple Claude API calls (tool-calling rounds, synthesis, streaming). For a personal assistant handling daily queries, API costs accumulated steadily with no upper bound.

3. **Privacy posture**: Although Claude API calls are discrete and LifeOS stores no data remotely, the orchestrator — which sees the full context of every query including personal notes, emails, and messages — was running through a third-party API. Running orchestration locally eliminates this data transit entirely.

4. **Platform constraints**: macOS-specific requirements (launchd, FDA wrappers, TCC scanning workarounds) added operational complexity. The `LifeOS.app` FDA wrapper, launchd plists, and TCC-driven venv placement ([ADR-005](005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md)) were all workarounds for macOS restrictions that don't exist on Linux.

5. **ROCm and GPU ecosystem**: The target workstation ships with an AMD GPU requiring ROCm, which has mature Linux support but no macOS support.

## Decision

### Primary server migration

Migrate the LifeOS server from the Mac Mini (macOS) to a Linux workstation with a high-VRAM AMD GPU. The Linux machine becomes the primary host for:
- FastAPI server
- ChromaDB vector store
- Ollama (query routing)
- Local LLM server (orchestration and synthesis)
- Nightly sync pipeline
- All portable data sources (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, financial data, notes vault)

### Local LLM for orchestration

Replace the Claude API as the orchestrator with a local LLM served via `llama-server` on the local GPU. The agentic chat loop and RAG synthesis — the highest-volume LLM calls — now run entirely locally by default.

Create a unified LLM client (`api/services/llm_client.py`) that abstracts over both local (OpenAI-compatible) and Anthropic backends. The client handles bidirectional tool-schema translation, streaming format differences, stop-reason normalization, and system-prompt format conversion.

Add `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND` setting to `config/settings.py` to switch between `local` and `anthropic` backends without code changes. Specialized Claude API calls (relationship insights, fact extraction, tone analysis, web search) are retained on Anthropic where frontier-model quality provides clear value.

### Mac Mini role change

Demote the Mac Mini to an "Apple Data Agent" role. It runs a single nightly cron job that:
1. Exports Apple-only data (iMessage, phone calls, contacts, photos face data)
2. Pushes exports to the Linux server via rsync/SSH

### Service management

Replace macOS launchd and FDA wrappers with systemd on Linux:
- `lifeos-api.service` — API server (uses `scripts/server.sh foreground`)
- `lifeos-chromadb.service` — ChromaDB vector store
- `lifeos-sync.timer` — Nightly sync pipeline
- `lifeos-watchdog.timer` — ChromaDB health monitoring

The `LifeOS.app` FDA wrapper is no longer needed on the LifeOS server. Linux has no TCC-equivalent file-access restrictions. The wrapper is still used on the Mac for the Apple Data Agent role.

### Codebase compatibility

Keep the codebase dual-compatible (Linux and macOS) via OS-detection wrappers:
- Shell scripts use `uname` checks for BSD vs GNU tool differences (e.g., `stat -f%z` vs `stat -c%s`).
- Python code uses `sys.platform` guards for macOS-specific imports (e.g., `pyobjc`).
- Scripts synced between the MacBook (macOS editor) and Linux (server) must work on both platforms.

### External venv convention

The external venv pattern from [ADR-005](005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md) (`~/.venvs/lifeos`) is retained by convention, even though the original TCC motivation no longer applies on Linux. The practice has proven useful regardless of platform: it keeps the venv out of file-sync tools (previously iCloud, now whatever the operator uses) and avoids bloating the project directory with machine-specific binary artifacts.

## Rationale

- **Privacy**: The orchestrator now runs locally by default. No personal data transits to any external API for the primary chat flow.
- **Cost**: Orchestration and synthesis (the highest-volume API calls) become zero marginal cost when on the local backend. Only specialized calls (relationship insights, fact extraction, web search) still use paid API tiers.
- **Latency**: Local LLM inference on a high-VRAM GPU eliminates network round-trips for the agentic loop, reducing per-turn latency.
- **Hardware utilization**: A 96GB VRAM GPU can run a 120B-parameter model with overhead for prefix caching and concurrent requests — capability that was impossible on the Mac Mini.
- **Operational simplicity**: systemd is more transparent and debuggable than launchd + FDA wrappers. No more TCC scanning delays, no more `.app` bundles for file access on the server side.
- **Retained flexibility**: The `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND` toggle and unified LLM client mean the system can fall back to the Claude API for orchestration if local model quality degrades for a specific use case. Specialist calls remain on Anthropic regardless.

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep Everything on Claude API (no local LLM)

Run LifeOS on Linux with all LLM calls still going to the Claude API. This was used as a stabilization milestone (Phases 1–2 of the migration).

**Rejected because:** It leaves the cost and privacy motivations unaddressed. The local LLM was the primary driver for acquiring high-VRAM hardware in the first place. Keeping the Claude API as the sole orchestrator would make the GPU investment largely wasted.

### Full Local (no Claude API at all)

Replace all Claude API calls — including relationship insights, fact extraction, tone analysis, and web search — with local models.

**Rejected because:** Frontier-model quality provides measurable value for these specialized tasks. Relationship analysis over sensitive personal data benefits from Opus-level reasoning. Web search requires Anthropic's built-in search tool, which has no local equivalent. The hybrid approach (local orchestrator + cloud specialists) captures the majority of cost and privacy benefits while preserving quality where it matters most.

### vLLM Instead of llama-server

vLLM was initially planned as the local inference server.

**Rejected because:** llama-server (from llama.cpp) provided better ROCm compatibility with the target GPU and simpler deployment for a single-user system. vLLM's strengths (high-throughput batching, PagedAttention for concurrent users) are less relevant for a system serving one user. llama-server's lower operational overhead was a better fit.

### Cloud VM with GPU

Run LifeOS on a cloud VM with an attached GPU (e.g., AWS p4d, Lambda Labs) to avoid hardware procurement.

**Rejected because:** This contradicts LifeOS's core principle that all data stays local. Hosting personal emails, messages, therapy notes, and financial data on a cloud VM — even one you control — introduces attack surface and ongoing cost that self-hosted hardware avoids. The workstation is a one-time capital expense with no recurring cloud bills.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Orchestration runs locally by default — no personal data sent to external APIs for the primary chat flow.
- Zero marginal cost for orchestration and synthesis when on local backend (previously the largest API expense).
- Lower latency for agentic chat interactions (no network round-trips per tool-calling round).
- systemd provides cleaner service management than launchd + FDA wrappers.
- Hardware overhead allows future model upgrades without architecture changes.
- Dual-compatible codebase means development workflow (edit on MacBook, run on server) is preserved.

### Negative

- Hardware dependency: LifeOS now requires specific GPU hardware. If the workstation fails, there is no automatic fallback (though `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=anthropic` can restore Claude API orchestration manually).
- Model quality variance: a local 120B-class model may underperform Claude for certain query types, particularly complex multi-step reasoning or nuanced tool selection. Ongoing prompt tuning may be required.
- Operational complexity: two machines (Linux server + Mac for Apple data) instead of one Mac Mini. The Apple Data Agent adds a nightly rsync dependency.
- ROCm ecosystem: AMD GPU tooling (ROCm, PyTorch ROCm builds) is less mature than NVIDIA CUDA. Occasional compatibility issues with new PyTorch versions are expected.
- Dual-platform maintenance: OS-detection wrappers in shell scripts and Python add conditional complexity that must be tested on both platforms.
- Local model tool-calling reliability may be lower than Claude's, causing agent loop failures or degraded responses. Mitigation: the backend toggle allows falling back to Claude API per-session or globally.
- Apple Data Agent timing: if the Mac fails to export before the nightly sync runs on Linux, Apple data sources will be stale. Mitigation: staleness checks and alerting before sync.
