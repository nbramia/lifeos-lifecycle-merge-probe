- `012-embedding-pipeline.md` — GPU embedding pipeline with CPU fallback
- `013-fitness-store.md` — Self-data fitness store, separate from the person-centric CRM model
- `014-apple-health-collection.md` — Apple Health via an iOS Shortcut (a Mac has no HealthKit store)
- `015-healthbridge-app.md` — HealthBridge iOS app as the recommended collector (amends 014)
- `016-voice-gateway-reverse-proxy.md` — Voice gateway reverse-proxied through LifeOS **(Amended by 021)**
- `017-retire-ollama-llama-server-routing.md` — Ollama retired; query routing moved onto the shared llama-server runtime (supersedes 006)
- `018-api-spend-requires-consent.md` — LifeOS never picks an API-billed engine on its own (amends 008)
- `019-turn-owned-by-server.md` — a chat turn's lifetime is owned by the server, not the SSE connection watching it **(Amended by 020)**

- `021-voice-turn-persistence-tee.md` — `POST turn/stream` tees a Hermes-backend voice turn into the conversation store, the one exception to 016's "no voice logic" (amends 016)
- `022-macos-fda-inheritance-and-restart.md` — corrects 010's `exec`/`run` FDA-inheritance description and documents two macOS restart-safety lessons (amends 010)
- `024-remote-llm-backend.md` — `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=remote` makes the configured paid OpenAI-compatible provider the standing default engine (supersedes 009)
- `025-specialist-call-fallback.md` — relationship insights, fact extraction, and CRM tone analysis fall back to local/remote when no Anthropic key is set (amends 009)

## Key Principles

- ADRs are **append-only**. Never modify an accepted ADR. The only acceptable in-place edit is adding a `**Superseded By:** ADR-NNN` or `**Amended by:** ADR-NNN` pointer in the frontmatter.
- Naming: `NNN-kebab-case.md`. Sequential numbering, never reuse numbers.
- Every ADR must include frontmatter: `**Status:** Complete | Partial | Draft`, `**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD`, `**Decision:** Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated`, and (if applicable) `**Superseded By:** ADR-NNN` / `**Amended by:** ADR-NNN`.
- Required sections: Context, Decision, Rationale, **Alternatives Considered** (each alternative + explicit "Rejected because"), **Consequences** split into **Positive** and **Negative**, Related Documents (4-bucket structure: Design Context / Specifications / Operational / Code References).
- Target length: 200–500 lines (max 800). Split into multiple ADRs if a single decision is too sprawling.
- See [docs/AGENTS.md § ADR Template](../AGENTS.md#adr-template) for the full template.
