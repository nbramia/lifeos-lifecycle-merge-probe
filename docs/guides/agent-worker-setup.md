# Agent Worker Setup

> **Status:** Complete
> **Last Updated:** 2026-09-05
> **Audience:** Operators

One-time setup for the external agent worker that picks up engine-assigned tasks (`#claude` / `#codex` / `#hermes` / `#local` / `#cloud`) and executes them via Claude (Anthropic Managed Agents), Hermes, a remote OpenAI-compatible provider, or a local Gemma model.

> **Env-var reference:** every `LIFEOS_*` and third-party variable mentioned below is defined in [configuration.md](configuration.md) with its default, type, and "when to change" notes. This guide gives operator-flow context; configuration.md is the catalog.

---

## What this setup covers

- **Local LLM** set to `unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF`. Smaller VRAM footprint, leaves headroom for the embedding model to coexist.
- **MCP HTTP transport** on `mcp_server.py` so a remote agent platform (Anthropic Managed Agents) can call LifeOS tools without stdio access to the host.
- **Bearer-token auth** required by the HTTP transport. The stdio transport (used by local Claude Code) has no token check.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** exposes the bearer-protected HTTP endpoint to the public internet.

---

## Step 1 — Swap the local LLM to Gemma

The `LIFEOS_LLM_MODEL` env var controls which GGUF `llama-server` loads. The repo default is Gemma:

```bash
# .env (or .env.example to see the documented options)
LIFEOS_LLM_MODEL=unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF
```

After setting it, re-install the systemd unit and restart:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
sudo systemctl restart lifeos-llm
```

Verify Gemma is loaded:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq
# Should report the Gemma model id, not gpt-oss.
```

If chat formatting looks broken on `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=local` requests, try adding `--chat-template gemma3` to the `ExecStart` line of `config/systemd/lifeos-llm.service` — Gemma 4 generally works with `--jinja` (the embedded Jinja template) but some llama.cpp builds prefer the explicit template flag.

---

## Step 2 — Generate a bearer token

The MCP HTTP transport refuses to start without a bearer token. Generate one and add it to `.env`:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```bash
# .env
LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN=<paste the generated hex string>
```

Keep `.env` out of version control (it already is via `.gitignore`). Never commit a real token.

Optional overrides (defaults shown):

```bash
# LIFEOS_MCP_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1   # bind localhost only; Cloudflare Tunnel handles public exposure
# LIFEOS_MCP_HTTP_PORT=8765
```

---

## Step 3 — Enable the MCP HTTP systemd unit

`setup-systemd.sh` enables `lifeos-mcp-http.service` automatically when it detects a bearer token in `.env`:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
sudo systemctl status lifeos-mcp-http
```

Smoke-test locally (still 401 from outside because the bind is localhost — that's expected):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | jq '.result.tools | length'
# Should print a positive integer (the number of registered tools).
```

A request without the header should return 401:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
# 401
```

---

## Step 4 — Expose via Cloudflare Tunnel

Anthropic Managed Agents (and any other remote MCP caller) need to reach `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` from the public internet. Use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) — outbound-only, no inbound firewall rules.

If you already run `cloudflared` for another service (e.g., QuickStage), add a route to the existing tunnel config. Otherwise, follow the Cloudflare Zero Trust quickstart to create a tunnel for your account.

Example `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` snippet (replace placeholders):

```yaml
tunnel: <your-tunnel-uuid>
credentials-file: /home/<your-user>/.cloudflared/<tunnel-uuid>.json

ingress:
  # ... your other routes ...
  - hostname: mcp.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:8765
  - service: http_status:404
```

Add a DNS record (CNAME `mcp.example.com` → `<tunnel-uuid>.cfargotunnel.com`) and reload `cloudflared`.

Verify from outside the host:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | jq '.result.tools | length'
```

Hardening upgrade (deferred to a later issue): swap the bearer-token check for a [Cloudflare Access service token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/) for revocable, per-token audit logging. Bearer token is fine for v1.

---

## Step 4b — Provision the Managed Agents preset, environment, and vault (Claude path)

Tasks tagged `#cloud-haiku` / `#cloud-sonnet` route to Claude on Anthropic's [Managed Agents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview) platform. Bare `#cloud` routes to your configured remote OpenAI-compatible provider instead (see [configuration.md](configuration.md#openai-compatible-remote-provider)). Per [ADR-018](../adr/018-api-spend-requires-consent.md) an explicit tag is required: an untagged task whose title merely *implies* cloud connectors asks you which engine to use rather than dispatching to the API. Set this section up if you want the Managed Agents path available at all — it is the API-billed route, and the only one that reaches Vault-authenticated connectors. The architecture has three reusable resources you set up once in the [Anthropic console](https://platform.claude.com):

- **Agent preset** (`agent_…`) — model, system prompt, MCP servers, tools, skills. Sessions reference it by ID.
- **Environment** (`env_…`) — where tool calls execute. Cloud container by default; self-hosted sandbox tracked in [#111](https://github.com/nbramia/LifeOS/issues/111).
- **Vault** (`vlt_…`) — OAuth credentials for MCP servers, matched to the MCP URLs declared in the agent preset.

> **Beta caveat:** Managed Agents launched April 2026 and the request/response schemas are still evolving. If a request fails with a 4xx, check the [Anthropic docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents) and update `api/services/agent_worker/managed_driver.py` accordingly.

### 1. Create the Vault

Workspace → Vaults → New Vault. Copy the `vlt_…` ID. Add credentials for whichever first-party connectors you want the agent to use (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Superhuman) and any custom MCPs (Slack, Ramp, Granola, Asana, etc.).

> **URL byte-match is required.** Each Vault credential stores against an `mcp_server_url`. When the agent connects to an MCP at runtime, Anthropic matches the agent preset's `mcp_servers.url` against the Vault entry's `mcp_server_url` byte-for-byte (no trailing slash, exact subdomain, exact path). If the URLs differ at all, you'll see `MCP server '<name>' initialize failed: no credential is stored for this server URL` in the session-error stream. Copy URLs by paste rather than re-typing.

The LifeOS MCP needs a `static_bearer` credential. The console UI may default to OAuth flow; if you don't see a "static bearer" option, add it via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/vaults/$VAULT_ID/credentials" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"display_name\": \"LifeOS MCP\",
    \"auth\": {
      \"type\": \"static_bearer\",
      \"mcp_server_url\": \"https://<your-mcp-hostname>/mcp\",
      \"token\": \"<LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN from Step 2>\"
    }
  }"
```

### 2. Create the cloud Environment

Workspace → Environments → New → Cloud.

> **Set `networking.type` to `unrestricted` at creation time.** The console UI defaults to `limited` mode with `allow_mcp_servers: false`, which blocks every MCP host and yields `400 MCP server host(s) blocked by environment network policy` on every session create. If you already created the environment with the default and want to fix it without recreating, `POST` (not PATCH — that returns 405) the config update.
>
> **Caveat:** the body below sends a complete `config` object that replaces the existing config wholesale. If you've also set `init_script`, package lists, or env vars, GET the current config first and merge before POSTing. For a fresh environment with only `networking` set, this single command is fine:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/environments/$ENV_ID" \
>   -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
>   -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
>   -H "anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01" \
>   -H "content-type: application/json" \
>   -d '{"config":{"type":"cloud","networking":{"type":"unrestricted"}}}'
> ```

Copy the `env_…` ID.

### 3. Create the Agent preset

Workspace → Agents → New. Paste the YAML below (replace the LifeOS hostname with yours, replace each MCP `url` with the value your Vault uses for that integration — they must match exactly):

```yaml
name: LifeOS Worker
description: Autonomous executor for agent-tagged tasks from LifeOS.
model:
  id: claude-sonnet-5
  speed: standard
system: |-
  <role>
  You are an autonomous task executor running outside the operator's
  LifeOS personal-assistant system. You receive engine-assigned tasks from
  the operator's task list and complete them end to end without further
  input.
  </role>

  <environment>
  You run inside an Anthropic-managed cloud container, not on the
  operator's machine. Your bash/read/write/edit/glob/grep tools operate
  on the container's ephemeral filesystem — use them as scratch space.
  Persistent data lives behind the attached MCP servers.
  </environment>

  <mcp_routing>
  Default to the `lifeos` MCP for any personal data: calendar, gmail,
  drive, photos, contacts, financial transactions, notes, tasks,
  reminders, person profiles, conversation history. The `lifeos` MCP
  wraps all of these and is faster than going through cloud-hosted
  alternatives.

  Use work-system MCPs (whichever are attached — slack, asana, ramp,
  granola, etc.) when a task explicitly names that system; default to
  `lifeos` otherwise. Note that LifeOS has the capability to search
  both personal and work Google (gmail, calendar, drive) contexts.
  Use `web_search` / `web_fetch` for public web content.
  </mcp_routing>

  <output_format>
  Every task must end with a final assistant turn containing a
  one-paragraph text summary. Tool calls alone are not a complete
  response. After your last tool call, produce a text turn summarizing
  what you did and the key result. Be concrete: include specific names,
  counts, decisions, links. Skip filler phrases like "I have completed
  the task." Match the operator's voice when drafting on their behalf:
  direct, lowercase-leaning, no LinkedIn-speak.

  Critically: your final turn must report results, not intentions. Never
  end with "I'll do X next" or "let me now Y" — those are promises, not
  completions. If you genuinely need more turns, take them now; only end
  the session when the task is actually done.

  The summary is delivered to the operator via Telegram, which does NOT
  render Markdown tables, headings (`#`), or code-block borders nicely.
  Prefer prose, bullets, and bold/italic emphasis. Avoid pipe-table
  syntax — write a short list with "Title — value" lines instead. When
  the natural output is a wide multi-column table, write it to a Google
  Doc/Sheet via the attached drive MCP and link to it from the summary.
  </output_format>

  <ambiguity>
  Do not ask clarifying questions during execution unless required in
  order to complete the task. If possible, make a reasonable assumption,
  make an attempt, and if it doesn't work, try something else. Be
  persistent — your goal is to make the experience delightful for the
  user. Just note the assumptions made in your final summary.
  </ambiguity>

  <inter_agent>
  You can spawn child agents for parallel sub-work via the `lifeos` MCP:
  `lifeos_agent_spawn` (create), `lifeos_agent_check` (poll),
  `lifeos_agent_yield_until` (pause until children finish — preferred
  over polling, no idle billing), `lifeos_agent_kill` (terminate),
  `lifeos_agent_transcript_read`, `lifeos_agent_sessions_list`,
  `lifeos_agent_user_ask`. Every one of these tools requires
  `caller_session_id` — pass the `lifeos_session_id` value from the
  task brief above verbatim, on every inter-agent call.
  </inter_agent>

  <thinking>
  Respond directly on simple lookups. Reserve extended thinking for
  multi-step problems where it will meaningfully improve the answer.
  </thinking>
mcp_servers:
  - name: lifeos
    type: url
    url: https://<your-mcp-hostname>/mcp
  # …add `name, type: url, url` entries for each Vault MCP you want
  # available. Common cloud connectors include gdrive, superhuman,
  # slack, ramp, granola, asana — attach whichever ones the operator
  # has Vault credentials for.
tools:
  - configs: []
    default_config:
      enabled: true
      permission_policy:
        type: always_allow
    type: agent_toolset_20260401
  - configs: []
    default_config:
      enabled: true
      permission_policy:
        type: always_allow
    mcp_server_name: lifeos
    type: mcp_toolset
  # …add a matching mcp_toolset entry (same shape, with the matching
  # mcp_server_name) for every mcp_servers entry above.
skills: []
metadata: {}
```

The system prompt is structured per Anthropic's [prompting best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices) for Claude 4.6/4.7: XML section tags (literal instruction-following works better with explicit structure), positive framing, an explicit requirement to produce a final text turn after tool use (the model otherwise sometimes idles after a tool call without summarizing), and adaptive-thinking guidance.

Every `mcp_servers` entry must have a matching `mcp_toolset` in `tools` (and vice versa) — the API rejects the agent definition otherwise. Save and copy the returned `agent_…` ID.

### 4. Write the IDs to `.env`

```bash
LIFEOS_AGENT_PRESET_ID=agent_<your_agent_id>
LIFEOS_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_ID=env_<your_environment_id>
LIFEOS_AGENT_VAULT_ID=vlt_<your_vault_id>
LIFEOS_AGENT_MANAGED_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5   # informational; actual model lives in the preset
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...                    # already required for the Haiku preflight
```

### 5. Restart the worker

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lifeos-agent-worker
```

Without `LIFEOS_AGENT_PRESET_ID` or `LIFEOS_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, Claude-routed tasks park at `#agent-blocked` with an explanatory Telegram notification — the worker does not call the API without both IDs configured.

The Vault holds **only credentials**. Live data (Obsidian, photos, monarch, calendar index, etc.) is read live from LifeOS MCP and the other connected MCPs on every agent call — nothing is snapshotted to Anthropic's side.

---

## Step 5 — Enable the agent worker

`setup-systemd.sh` installs `lifeos-agent-worker.service`, which polls `/api/tasks` for claimable tasks (engine assignees). It's **off by default** so a fresh clone doesn't start consuming tasks unless you opt in.

To enable:

```bash
# .env
LIFEOS_AGENT_WORKER_AUTOSTART=true

# Optional knobs (defaults shown)
# LIFEOS_AGENT_WORKER_POLL_SECONDS=60
# LIFEOS_AGENT_DEFAULT_BUDGET_DOLLARS=5.00
# LIFEOS_AGENT_DAILY_CAP_DOLLARS=100.00
```

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
sudo systemctl status lifeos-agent-worker
tail -f logs/agent-worker.log
```

Once enabled, the worker claims engine-assigned todo/urgent tasks (engine tag alone is enough; bare `#agent` still works) and executes them: `#local` runs on the local Gemma path, `#cloud` on the configured remote provider, `#hermes` via Hermes, `#claude`/`#codex` via their CLIs, and Managed Agents when `#cloud-haiku`/`#cloud-sonnet` consent tags are present.

To smoke-test the claim path:

```bash
# Create a task assigned to an engine (Hermes here)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"description":"agent worker smoke test","tags":["hermes"]}'

# Within ~60s, the worker should:
#   1. add #agent-running on the task
#   2. record a session row in data/agent_sessions.db
#   3. append events to data/agent_transcripts/<session_id>.jsonl
#   4. mark the task complete
#   5. send a Telegram notification (if TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is configured)
```

To pause new claims without stopping the worker, set `LIFEOS_AGENT_DAILY_CAP_DOLLARS=0` and restart — the worker keeps polling but refuses to claim anything new.

### Security model

By design, the local executor runs `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, and `WebFetch` with **no sandbox** — the agent has the same filesystem and shell access as the operator. This is intentional (see [AGENTS.md § Design Principles](../../AGENTS.md)) and means an agent task can:

- Read or modify any file the operator can read or modify
- Execute arbitrary shell commands (including `rm`, `curl`, etc.)
- Fetch any URL the host can reach (SSRF surface — an internal HTTP service accessible from the host is reachable to the agent)

The Haiku preflight sanity-check is the only guard against destructive-shaped tasks. Operators should:
- Audit engine-assigned tasks before they reach the worker (look at your task list)
- Keep the daily $-cap set so even a runaway loop can't burn unlimited budget
- Treat agent-touchable secrets the same as operator-touchable secrets

---

## Codex MCP setup (`#codex` path)

`#codex` tasks (and `/codex`) run the Codex CLI through `CodexExecutor`.
Unlike Claude Code — which inherits the `lifeos` MCP server from
`~/.claude.json` automatically — Codex only reaches LifeOS data through an
`[mcp_servers.*]` block in its own config. A fresh Codex install has none, so
the agent is **context-blind to personal data**: it can edit files and run
shell commands, but `lifeos_search`, `lifeos_ask`, `lifeos_calendar_search`,
etc. don't exist for it.

The worker prepends the same capabilities briefing it gives the managed/local
routes, so Codex *knows* these tools should exist — but the tools only work
once the MCP server is wired. Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml` (or
`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.lifeos]
command = "<venv>/bin/python"            # your lifeos venv python, e.g. ~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python
args = ["<lifeos-repo>/mcp_server.py"]   # absolute path to mcp_server.py in your LifeOS checkout
```

`mcp_server.py` already serves stdio for CLI agents (the same entry point
Claude Code uses), so no extra process or port is involved — Codex spawns it
on demand.

**Verify** the server is registered:

```bash
codex mcp list                          # lifeos should appear in the list
# or, if your codex build has no `mcp` subcommand:
grep -A2 'mcp_servers.lifeos' ~/.codex/config.toml
```

If the block is missing, the agent worker logs a one-time warning on the first
`#codex` dispatch (`Codex has no [mcp_servers.lifeos] …`) so a misconfigured
machine surfaces in `logs/lifeos-api-error.log` rather than silently producing
context-blind runs.

### Codex skills (`#codex` parity with `#claude`)

The engine-agnostic LifeOS workflow skills (`/standup`, `/catchup`, `/stale`,
`/sync-health`, `/remove-worktree`) can be installed for Codex. Codex
discovers skills only from
`~/.codex/skills/` (or `$CODEX_HOME/skills`) — there's no project-level skills
dir — so this is a machine-local install, like the MCP block above:

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/install_codex_skills.py
# Restart Codex to pick them up.
```

The script converts each skill from Claude Code's slash-command dialect
(`$ARGUMENTS`, `` !`cmd` `` injection) into Codex's `SKILL.md` format. Re-run
after editing the source skills under `.claude/skills/`. `/mine-for-ideas` and
`/tune` are intentionally **not** ported — they drive Claude's subagent loop or
the LifeOS orchestrator internals and have no Codex equivalent.

### Implementation lifecycle skills

`/implement`, `/draft-issue`, `/pr-check`, `/merge-pr`, `/review-pr`, and
`/address-review` come from the `benjamcalvin/bootstraps` marketplace, not from
this repo. The marketplace is cross-compatible: its `implement-lifecycle` and
`issue-management` plugins install in Codex through Codex's plugin browser, and
in Claude Code at **user scope** (`/plugin` → add the `benjamcalvin/bootstraps`
marketplace). `scripts/install_codex_skills.py` does not sync them, so a Codex
machine needs the plugin installed to have them.

### Codex computer use — NOT available to the worker (use delegation)

`codex features list` shows `computer_use` / `browser_use` / `in_app_browser`
as `stable`+`true`, but those are **capability flags, not runtime availability**.
Verified empirically (a forced-browser `codex exec` task returns "BROWSER
UNAVAILABLE") and confirmed against OpenAI's docs — Codex computer use and the
in-app browser are **Codex *desktop app* features**, not CLI/`exec` features:

- They are documented only under the [Codex **app**](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/computer-use),
  and the browser is *in-app* — hosted by the desktop/TUI runtime. Headless
  `codex exec` (how the worker runs Codex) has no app, so the tool is never
  registered.
- Computer use is **macOS/Windows only** — this worker runs on **Linux**, where
  it isn't offered at all.
- It also requires a Computer Use **plugin** installed via Codex settings, an
  active desktop session, and OS screen-recording/accessibility permissions —
  none of which exist for a background `codex exec` subprocess.

This is an upstream constraint, not a LifeOS misconfiguration — there's no flag
that makes it work in the worker.

**So browser/GUI work routes to Claude Code instead.** Every `#codex` (and
`#claude`) agent is told its LifeOS session id and can call `lifeos_agent_spawn`
with `model="claude_code"` to hand a browser sub-task to the `--chrome`-enabled
Claude Code CLI (which *does* work headless on Linux), then monitor it with
`lifeos_agent_check`. This delegation is the supported path for any task that
needs a real browser.

## Card assignment: running a card on another machine (#851)

A board card (or a `#claude`/`#codex` task carrying `host` / `model` /
`effort` fields) can name a machine other than this API host to run on.
The worker reaches it over ssh — no worker process runs on the remote
machine, only the API host's own worker dispatches, and it does so by
wrapping the identical local command in an ssh call.

**Configure the registry.** `LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS` in `.env` is a JSON object
mapping a board-facing host name to an ssh target:

```bash
LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS={"laptop": "operator@laptop.example", "studio": "studio-box"}
```

`studio-box` above is a plain `~/.ssh/config` `Host` alias — either form
works, since the value is passed straight to `ssh`. A host name not in
this map fails the task closed (`#agent-failed`, reason naming the host)
without ever attempting a connection; leaving `LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS` unset
(the default, `{}`) disables every remote host.

**The board's host picker** shows this same registry as a
dropdown — the API host plus every name in `LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS` — rather
than a free-text field, each marked `(offline)` or `(unknown)` when it
isn't reachable. Reachability comes from `tailscale status --json` when
the `tailscale` binary is available; without it (or if a host simply
isn't a Tailscale peer — plain LAN ssh works fine without Tailscale at
all) the marker is `(unknown)`, never a guessed `(offline)`. Nothing
further to configure — the picker reads `LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS` fresh, the
same registry the ssh spawn mechanism below uses.

**ssh prerequisites, per remote machine:**

- Key-based auth already working non-interactively: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes
  <target> echo ok` must succeed with no password/passphrase prompt (an
  agent-loaded key, or an unencrypted key referenced by `~/.ssh/config`).
  `BatchMode=yes` is exactly what the worker itself passes, so this is the
  real precondition, not an approximation of it.
- The `claude` and/or `codex` CLI installed and authenticated on the
  remote machine's own account, the same way it is on this host (see Step 4b above for Claude Code auth,
  [Codex MCP setup](#codex-mcp-setup-codex-path) for Codex) — the remote invocation is the literal `claude`/`codex` binary on
  that machine's `$PATH`, so whatever makes it work locally on THAT
  machine (not this one) has to already be true there.
- The lifeos MCP server configured for whichever CLI runs there, exactly
  as on this host — a remote session with no `lifeos_*` tools is blind to
  personal data the same way a local one would be.
- For `/resume`/`/focus`/board-open's WezTerm launcher path: WezTerm
  installed and reachable the same way it is here — this repo doesn't yet
  replicate `_resume_env`'s local socket-discovery logic on the remote
  side, so the remote machine's own login-shell environment has to
  already make `wezterm cli spawn` work unassisted.

The remote spawn always unsets a small canonical list of provider
credential names (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, and a few others) regardless of what this API host's own
environment contains, but names beyond that list exported by a registered
host's own non-interactive shell are not stripped — keep provider
credentials out of a registered host's shell startup files.

**Connect timeout.** `LIFEOS_AGENT_SSH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` (default 10
seconds) bounds how long ssh may spend establishing the connection before
giving up — applies to remote spawn, remote kill, and remote resume/focus
alike. An unreachable host fails within this window with the ssh error as
the failure reason. A remote spawn's initial handshake read (waiting for
the `PGID:` line that confirms the remote process actually started) is
bounded separately, at this connect timeout plus 5 seconds — it covers an
auth stall or a host that accepts the connection but never answers, and
fails with its own distinct reason (`host <name> did not answer within
<n>s`) rather than the ssh connection error above.

**What doesn't work remotely:** Apple-data tasks (iMessage, Photos,
Contacts) need Full Disk Access, which is granted per-launching-process
and can't be inherited over ssh — see
[agent-worker.md](../specs/technical/agent-worker.md#card-assignment-851).
The Apple Data Agent's own export/import pipeline
([operations.md](operations.md)) is the supported path for cross-machine
Apple data, not this mechanism.

### Remote session parity: transcript mirror

Once a host is in the registry above, `/agents` can also mirror its
Claude Code and Codex transcripts onto this box — the difference between a
remote session showing only status and a prompt preview versus real token
counts, cost, tool calls, and a live transcript feed. See
[product/agent-viz.md § Remote session parity](../specs/product/agent-viz.md#remote-session-parity)
for what the operator sees and
[technical/agent-viz.md § Remote transcript mirror](../specs/technical/agent-viz.md#remote-transcript-mirror)
for the mechanism.

**Settings** are all in `.env`, all optional, and safe on a fresh install
since `LIFEOS_AGENT_HOSTS` defaults to `{}` (the mirror is a no-op with
nothing registered) — see [configuration.md § Remote Session Parity](configuration.md#remote-session-parity-transcript-mirror)
for the full variable reference, including that a relative
`LIFEOS_AGENT_TRANSCRIPT_MIRROR_DIR` resolves against the repo root, not
the process's working directory.

**What a registered host needs, beyond the ssh prerequisites above:**

- The same key-based, non-interactive ssh auth already required for card
  assignment — the mirror reuses it, no separate credential.
- `rsync` installed on both this box and the remote machine (the same
  pattern `scripts/apple_data_agent.sh` uses for the Apple export
  pipeline) — the mirror pull runs `rsync` locally, over ssh to the
  remote side.
- Nothing else — the mirror never writes to the remote host. It only
  reads `~/.claude/projects/` and `~/.codex/sessions/` (or whatever
  `LIFEOS_CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECTS_DIR` / `LIFEOS_CODEX_SESSIONS_DIR` are set
  to, assumed the same relative-to-home layout on every registered host)
  and pulls `*.jsonl` files one-way onto this box.

An unreachable host is skipped with one log line and never blocks another
host's pull or the API's own responsiveness — see the technical doc for
the concurrency and failure-isolation details.

## Working directory: run a local or cloud card in an isolated checkout

By default the local (`#local`) and remote (`#cloud`) routes run wherever
the worker process itself lives — on a normal install, the canonical
checkout that serves the live API. A card that edits files therefore
edits the running service's own source tree, which makes both routes
unusable for code work. Naming a working directory on the card fixes
that: a `working_dir` field pins the card's file reads, writes, and shell
commands to an isolated checkout instead.

**Set the field** the same way you'd set `host`/`model`/`effort` — an
inline `[key:: value]` field on the task line:

```
- [ ] Fix the off-by-one in the paginator #cloud [working_dir:: /srv/checkouts/example]
```

**Guardrails, checked before the model ever runs:**

- No `working_dir` named → the executor runs in the worker
  process's own working directory.
- A path that doesn't exist, or isn't a directory, fails the card closed
  (`#agent-failed`, reason naming the path) — no model call is made.
- A path that resolves to the worker's own checkout, or anywhere inside
  it, is refused the same way — the live service's tree can never be a
  card's target, so there's no way to point `working_dir` back at the
  install this worker is itself running from.
- A path one or more levels *above* the checkout is refused too — naming
  a parent directory would let file operations inside it reach the
  checkout's own files just as surely as naming the checkout directly.

**What this is and isn't.** It's a path-resolution guard, not a sandbox:
Read/Write/Edit are confined to the named directory (a `..` or symlink
escape is rejected), and Bash starts there, but a shell command can still
`cd` elsewhere or touch an absolute path outside it — exactly as an
ungoverned shell always could. Point `working_dir` at a scratch worktree
you're comfortable with the agent having full shell access inside, the
same trust model the worker already has everywhere else (see
[Security model](#security-model)).

## Cost-aware iteration

Iterating on Managed Agents prompts has a hidden tax: every fresh managed
session pays ~$0.40 cache_creation up front on the 100k-token preset. A few
suggestions to keep iteration cheap:

- **Cluster runs within 5 minutes.** Anthropic's prompt cache has a 5-minute
  TTL. Sessions dispatched within that window after a recent run hit
  `cache_read` (12.5× cheaper than `cache_creation`) instead of paying the
  full cache-cold cost. If you're iterating on a prompt shape, fire your
  reruns back-to-back, not spread across the hour.
- **Use `dry_run=true` to inspect routing without billing.** `lifeos_task_create`
  accepts a `dry_run` flag on engine-assigned tasks — it runs the cheap Haiku
  preflight (~$0.001), returns the routing decision and cost estimate, and
  does *not* dispatch a managed session. Use this when you're verifying tag
  parsing or routing logic; only flip `dry_run=false` once the dispatch
  shape looks right.
- **Override the model-for-tests setting.** `LIFEOS_AGENT_MANAGED_MODEL_FOR_TESTS`
  in `.env` overrides `LIFEOS_AGENT_MANAGED_MODEL` for client-side cost
  accounting. Set to `claude-haiku-4-5` while iterating so the dollar
  figures the worker logs match what you'd be charged if the preset were
  pointed at Haiku.
- **Keep tests mocked.** A process-wide pytest guard fails any test that
  reaches `api.anthropic.com` or `platform.claude.com`. Tests must use
  `httpx.MockTransport`, `AsyncMock`, or a stub `caller`. A test that
  legitimately needs a real call must carry `@pytest.mark.allow_anthropic_api`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `lifeos-mcp-http` won't start, log says "requires LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN" | Token not set in `.env`, or systemd didn't reload | Set the token, then `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart lifeos-mcp-http` |
| 401 with a token that should work | Token in `.env` doesn't match the one the caller is sending | Re-read `.env`, ensure no quotes or trailing whitespace; restart `lifeos-mcp-http` after edits |
| 502/504 from the tunnel | The MCP HTTP service isn't running on the configured port | `systemctl status lifeos-mcp-http` and `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` |
| Gemma loads but responses look garbled | Chat template mismatch | Add `--chat-template gemma3` to `lifeos-llm.service` `ExecStart` |
| `llama-server` crashes on Gemma | Insufficient VRAM, or stale cached model | Check `nvidia-smi`/`rocm-smi`; re-download with `llama-server -hf unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF` once and confirm |
| `llama-server` starts but `/v1/models` returns `503 Loading model` or `404`, log shows "sha256 mismatch" + "HEAD failed, status: 404" | Upstream HF model was updated; local cache fails llama.cpp's integrity check and the redownload 404s, leaving the server in router mode with no model loaded | Point at the local GGUF directly: set `LIFEOS_LLM_MODEL_PATH=/absolute/path/to/cached.gguf` (and `LIFEOS_LLM_MMPROJ_PATH` for vision models) in `.env`, then re-run `sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh` |
| Agent worker logs "daily spend cap reached" | `LIFEOS_AGENT_DAILY_CAP_DOLLARS` is 0 or already exceeded today | Raise the cap or wait until local midnight |
| Worker doesn't pick up an engine-assigned task | Task isn't `status=todo`/`urgent`, missing engine tag, or worker isn't enabled | `systemctl status lifeos-agent-worker`; `curl 'http://localhost:8000/api/tasks?status=todo&tag=local'` |
| `#codex` agent can't find personal data / doesn't call `lifeos_*` tools | No `[mcp_servers.lifeos]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` | Add the block (see [Codex MCP setup](#codex-mcp-setup-codex-path)); confirm with `codex mcp list` |
| Managed Agents session stuck running | Worker can't reach the API, or the remote session is genuinely long | Find the `managed_agent_session_id` in `data/agent_sessions.db` (`SELECT task_id, session_id, managed_agent_session_id FROM sessions WHERE status='running'`). Cancel via the Anthropic console, or `curl -X DELETE -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" -H "anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01" https://api.anthropic.com/v1/sessions/<remote_id>`. The worker's next poll sees a 404 (mapped to `cancelled`) and finalizes. |
