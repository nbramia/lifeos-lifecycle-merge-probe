# Candidate Verification CI

**Status:** Partial
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-09
**Audience:** Operators

Candidate verification runs on GitHub-hosted ephemeral runners. The publisher
passes the protected base commit SHA it observed while building the candidate;
the job separately checks out that exact runner SHA and the exact candidate
SHA, proves both checkout identities, and disables persisted credentials. It uses only
`contents: read`, invokes the base revision's verifier against the candidate
checkout, creates a synthetic runtime home through that verifier, and runs
the existing fast-unit plus server-free-browser lanes. It installs
dependencies from the candidate's `requirements.txt` under a CI-only exact
CPU torch constraint. CI installs that pinned CPU-only torch wheel from the
CPU index first, then resolves the complete unmodified candidate requirement
file against the same constraint; a candidate that declares an incompatible
torch version fails resolution instead of being silently rewritten. It installs Chromium through the
declared Playwright dependency, verifies the installed torch version is the
expected `+cpu` build with no CUDA or HIP build metadata, and records a
sorted installed-package fingerprint in the ephemeral runner output.

The `local` runner's `--parallel-browser-free` flag opts the browser-free
lane into `pytest-xdist` at `--workers`' worker count (`browser-free`
excludes `requires_server`, so independent workers never share a live
server). It defaults off, and this CI job does not pass it, so CI's
browser-free lane stays serial.

`nbramia/LifeOS` is a User-owned repository, not an organization. GitHub
merge queue and Enterprise "required workflow" repository rules are both
organization/Enterprise-only features — not merely unconfigured, but
structurally unavailable here regardless of settings changes. Neither is
part of this design.

## Privacy-audit applicability

`tests/test_fixtures_no_personal_data.py::test_no_fixture_contains_a_real_sensitive_value`
compares committed fixtures with a locally reachable real `.env` without
loading it into the process environment. In an isolated candidate where that
file is intentionally inaccessible, only its exact existing no-real-`.env`
reason is recorded as named `not_applicable`; it is never reported as passed.
All other skipped, missing, errored, or failed tests remain blocking, and a
successful lane still requires at least one passed mandatory test; the direct
checkout/pre-push audit continues to run read-only whenever the `.env` exists.

## The actual gate: a dedicated App-issued required check

The publisher job is separate from candidate execution. It receives
`checks: write`, does not check out candidate files or consume candidate
artifacts, and reports the result for the event's exact candidate SHA. A
missing, cancelled, or failed execution maps to a failed aggregate result; no
docs-only path skips the aggregate job.

GitHub's required-status-check matching identifies a `context` string and a
reporting `app_id` — never which workflow file or run produced it. A
required check bound only to the generic GitHub Actions app (`app_id: 15368`)
or left unbound (`app_id: -1`, "any app") can be satisfied by any workflow in
the repository with `checks: write`, including one a candidate PR adds or
modifies itself, because a `pull_request`-triggered (not `_target`) workflow
resolves its own definition from the candidate's tree. Closing this requires
the required check to be bound to a **dedicated GitHub App** whose
installation token is minted only inside the `publish-aggregate` job (never
stored as a persisted secret used by any candidate-influenceable workflow,
and never given to the `execute-candidate` job at all).

A **repository secret is not sufficient to hold that App's private key**,
even though only `publish-aggregate` references it: a repository secret is
available to any same-repo, non-fork workflow run regardless of which
workflow file defines it, so a candidate-authored `pull_request`-triggered
workflow could add its own step referencing that same secret name and mint
a valid App token itself — a separate job in the checked-in workflow does
not create a boundary a candidate's own new workflow file can't cross. The
key must instead be an **environment secret**, scoped to a
`candidate-verification-publish` GitHub Environment whose **deployment
branch policy is configured to exactly `main`** (no tags, no `refs/pull/*`,
and not the "protected branches" fallback unless `main` is the only
protected branch — check the actual configured value, don't assume). Only a
job that declares `environment: candidate-verification-publish` can resolve
the secret, and GitHub denies that resolution unless the run ref matches the
policy — so a `pull_request`-triggered run (whose ref is the pull request
head/merge ref, never `main`) is refused the secret even if its own new
workflow file declares the same environment name. `execute-candidate` never
declares this environment.

There are two independent event paths in `.github/workflows/candidate-verification.yml`,
never conflated:

- **`pull_request_target`** publishes `candidate-verification-shadow` for a
  PR head. It is diagnostic — fast, visible PR feedback — and must never be
  a required check.
- **`workflow_dispatch`** (input: `candidate_sha`) verifies the exact
  normalized two-parent candidate `scripts/candidate_publisher.py`
  constructs, and publishes the actual required check, `candidate-verification`.
  Both event types resolve the workflow's own YAML from a trusted ref (the
  base branch for `pull_request_target`, the `--ref` the dispatch targets —
  always `main` — for `workflow_dispatch`), never from the candidate's own
  `.github/workflows/**`, which is what keeps a candidate-modified workflow
  file from ever running with elevated privilege.

For the authoritative dispatch, the publisher also supplies
`trusted_runner_sha`: the protected-base commit it observed before constructing
the candidate. The job verifies its `trusted-runner` checkout matches that
SHA, uses it as the verifier's base identity, and includes it in the aggregate
check summary. The authoritative dispatch additionally requires that SHA to
equal the immutable `github.workflow_sha` and the candidate's first parent;
a later advance of `main` therefore fails closed rather than silently
substituting a different runner implementation for the one claimed by that
check.

`scripts/candidate_publisher.py` orchestrates the actual publish: it builds
the candidate, pushes it to a disposable staging ref, dispatches
`workflow_dispatch` against it, polls for the resulting check via the
GitHub API filtered to the dedicated App's `app_id` (never accepting a
same-named check from any other app), and only then performs the atomic
`main`+source publish. See `scripts/candidate_publisher.py`'s module
docstring for the exact ordering guarantee (construct before verify, verify
before publish).

The production publisher rejects the generic Actions app (`15368`), the
wildcard issuer (`-1`), and every nonpositive app id without reading the pull request or
fetching any refs. The low-level check-polling helper can still be used by
disposable mechanics probes without an app filter, but that helper is not a
publication bypass: the production function and CLI always require a positive,
dedicated App id.

Before fetching and again immediately before the atomic push, publication
queries open PRs for another PR with the same head repository and branch via
GitHub's paginated REST endpoint. The target PR itself must appear with that
exact source identity before an empty conflict list is trusted. If one exists,
publication is refused because a single source-ref lease cannot
represent two open PRs safely. These API observations are point-in-time
exclusivity checks, not a GitHub metadata lock: a new PR can still be opened in
the final query-to-push interval, while the dual main/source SHA leases still
reject a source-content race. Stronger exclusion requires a branch policy or a
unique source-ref convention outside this publisher.

The atomic operation always advances the retained source ref to the exact
candidate SHA. With the default behavior, a later candidate-leased deletion
removes that source ref only after GitHub's native merged-PR bookkeeping has
recorded the merge; `--no-delete-source` skips that deletion and intentionally
leaves the source ref at the candidate SHA. It never restores the original PR
head, and a newer source commit causes the cleanup lease to retain the newer
ref.

## Enabling the Gate

1. Create the `candidate-verification-publish` Environment on the
   repository first, and set its deployment branch policy to exactly
   `main` — no tags, no `refs/pull/*`, and not the "protected branches"
   fallback unless `main` is genuinely the only branch marked protected.
   `python scripts/candidate_ci_setup.py OWNER/REPOSITORY
   --require-environment-locked-to-main` audits this.
2. Run `python scripts/github_app_setup.py OWNER/REPOSITORY`. This writes an
   auto-submitting manifest form to `github-app-manifest.html` (permissions:
   `checks: write` only, no webhook events) and starts a local callback
   listener. Open that file in an authenticated GitHub browser session and
   submit it — GitHub's App Manifest flow has no fully headless path at any
   permission level, so this one step needs an authenticated browser action;
   it does not need to be a specific human, only an authenticated session
   with the right access (an operator's own browser, or an authorized
   automated browser session acting on their behalf). The script then
   exchanges the resulting one-time code for real credentials, then checks
   whether the App is actually installed on the target repository using a
   short-lived App JWT signed in memory from the exchanged key, rather than
   the CLI user's OAuth installation endpoint. Registering an App and
   installing it are separate GitHub actions — a
   fresh App is ordinarily not installed yet). If it isn't, the script
   prints the installation URL and keeps running, polling until
   installation is confirmed — the exchanged private key exists only in
   this process's memory, so it deliberately waits rather than exiting and
   losing the only copy (which would force starting over from a fresh
   registration). Install the App on `nbramia/LifeOS` while it waits. Once
   installed, it confirms the destination environment's branch policy is
   genuinely locked to `main` before writing anything, and writes
   `LIFEOS_CANDIDATE_APP_ID` (variable) and
   `LIFEOS_CANDIDATE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (secret) directly into the
   `candidate-verification-publish` environment created in step 1 — never
   repository-level, and the private key is never printed, logged, or
   returned anywhere else in the process.
3. Configure branch protection's required status check for `main` to require
   `candidate-verification`, bound to that App's id.
4. Run the audited setup check before trusting that configuration:

```bash
python scripts/candidate_ci_setup.py OWNER/REPOSITORY \
    --require-app-scoped-gate --check-name candidate-verification \
    --trusted-app-id <the App's numeric id>
```

It deliberately fails when the configured required check is bound to the
generic Actions app, to the wildcard (`app_id: -1`), or to no app at all —
none of those identify a specific, non-candidate-controllable issuer. Enable
The required check serves as the merge gate when this command succeeds and
administrator enforcement is enabled.

Until then, retain the local broad pre-push gate. To roll back an already
enforced replacement, restore that blocking local gate first, then remove
the required-check requirement; never weaken protection before the local
gate is back in force.
