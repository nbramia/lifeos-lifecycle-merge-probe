# Doctor Bot — Self-Repair Surface

**Status:** Complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-03
**Audience:** Operator

The **doctor** bot's only job is fixing LifeOS itself. You message it when you notice LifeOS misbehaving or missing something; it converses with you to define the **goal**, locks that goal, then — on your approval — orchestrates the work end to end and reports back. It is a **goal-first orchestrator**: it supervises the implementation (subagents do the coding via `/implement`) rather than hand-coding inline, and every change lands through a reviewed, tested PR — never a direct push to `main`.

Unlike the `fitness` and `therapist` bots (pure chat surfaces), the doctor **orchestrates**: it supervises a real Claude Code session, and that session's progress, questions, and completion all come back to you. A message to the Telegram bot answers through **Hermes** by default, which drives that supervision conversationally (via `lifeos_agent_spawn`) rather than spawning a session directly the moment you send a message — see the transport note under Setup below. The clarify → goal → execute → confirm contract below is the same either way.

## Surfaces

- **Telegram** (primary): a dedicated `@BotFather` bot. Full round-trip — reply to a `[CLARIFY]`/`[GOAL]` message (swipe-to-reply) to answer, and reply to **any** other doctor message (status updates, heartbeats, acks, "On it") to drop a context note into that session's thread. Messages end with "↩️ reply in thread" or "🚫 do not reply" so the affordance is explicit. A fresh, non-threaded message starts a **new** repair.
- **Web / voice**: selecting the `doctor` persona in web chat (or via whisper-relay) spawns the same orchestrating session. You can answer its `[CLARIFY]`/`[GOAL]` from the web conversation too (`POST /api/conversations/{id}/answer`); notices also surface on the doctor's Telegram thread and the `/agents` page.

## The flow

This is the operator's-eye summary; the exact contract the session runs lives in [`config/personas/doctor.md`](../../config/personas/doctor.md) — treat that as authoritative if the two ever drift.

1. **You report a problem**, e.g. _"the calendar tool returns last week's events when I ask for this week."_
2. **Clarify the goal.** The doctor investigates the code and asks the minimum `[CLARIFY]` questions needed to pin down what "done" means. No work starts yet.
3. **Propose + approve the goal.** It emits a `[GOAL]` — a crisp success condition (issue filed, tested PR merged to `main`, restarted, confirmed). **This is the single human gate.** The goal arrives as one message that ends with the reply instructions; use Telegram's **Reply on that message** with **yes** to lock it (which arms the session's `/goal`), or with changes to refine it. Your reply is acked immediately ("Goal locked — starting work now"). A plain, non-threaded message starts a **new** repair instead of answering.
4. **Execute.** On approval it files the issue(s) via `/draft-issue`, then ships — adaptive to size:
   - **Small goal:** one branch → `/implement` → one PR → `main`.
   - **Multi-part goal:** an **integration branch** off `main`, each part landed as a sub-PR onto it (`/implement <issue> --base <integration-branch>`), then one PR integration→`main`, then cleanup.
5. **Confirm.** It brings the canonical checkout to merged `main`, restarts (the right way — see Autonomy and safety), and confirms with the revert handle: _"Shipped: PR #N merged, server restarted. Revert with: gh pr revert N."_

Once you install the [Human queue](human-queue.md) instruction paragraph in the doctor's instruction files, a repair that turns up something only you can do files a card instead of stalling, and resolves it once it observes the thing done.

## Setup

1. **Create the bot.** In Telegram, message `@BotFather` → `/newbot`, name it (e.g. "LifeOS Doctor"), and copy the token.
2. **Set the token** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_DOCTOR_BOT_TOKEN=<token-from-botfather>
   # TELEGRAM_DOCTOR_CHAT_ID=   # optional; defaults to TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
   ```
   The bot is registered in [`config/telegram_bots.json`](../../config/telegram_bots.json) and its behavior lives in [`config/personas/doctor.md`](../../config/personas/doctor.md). Leave the token unset to not run it.
3. **Prerequisites on the server:**
   - **Claude Code** installed and authenticated (`claude setup-token`) — same requirement as `/claude`. See [Claude Code Orchestration](claude-code-orchestration.md).
   - **`gh`** authenticated (`gh auth login`) so it can file issues and open/merge PRs.
   - The **agent worker** running (`lifeos-agent-worker`) — it runs the doctor's Claude Code sessions.
4. **Restart** to pick up the new bot: `./scripts/server.sh restart`.

**Transport.** By default the doctor Telegram bot's turns answer through the Hermes text backend (`LIFEOS_HERMES_BACKEND_URL`) — see [client-surfaces.md](../specs/technical/client-surfaces.md#telegram-bot-backends-684). If Hermes is unset or unreachable for a turn, the bot falls back to the native pipeline (a genuine Claude Code spawn) and says so in-channel, once. Neither path needs anything extra from you here — this only matters if you're debugging why a repair session is or isn't conversational.

## Autonomy and safety

- **One gate.** Full-auto from your goal approval through merge; `/implement`'s built-in adversarial review is the quality bar.
- **Always PR-gated, always revertable.** Even the smallest fix goes branch → PR → `main` with tests + docs + review; the doctor never pushes to `main`, and each change lands as a single revertable merge commit whose `gh pr revert` handle it reports.
- **The review is on the record.** The adversarial-review outcome is posted as a comment on the PR before it merges — what was checked, what it found, what changed in response. So "reviewed" is something you can read afterwards, not something you take on faith. The PR description is also brought up to date before merge, so it describes what actually shipped.
- **Escalation respected.** If `/implement` can't resolve its review findings after its rounds, the doctor leaves the PR open and reports the escalation instead of merging.
- **Subscription-billed, structurally.** The doctor runs on your Claude subscription and *cannot* fall back to the Anthropic API. The worker inherits the LifeOS `.env` (which carries `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the API-backed services), so the CLI is spawned with every `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CLAUDE*` variable stripped from its environment — the CLI prefers an API key over the claude.ai login, so leaving it none is the only way to guarantee the subscription. The same guarantee closes the side door: a session in this lineage that tries to spawn a Managed Agents child (`lifeos_agent_spawn(model="claude")`, which is API-billed) is refused. Both are code, not instructions.
- **Opus supervises, Sonnet implements.** The doctor session itself runs on Opus — goal-clarification, review, and validation are judgement work. The subagents that *write* the code run on Sonnet. Cost scales with the reviewing, not with the typing.
- **Isolation.** Implementation happens in throwaway worktrees off `origin/main` (pre-flight-cleaned via `scripts/cleanup-worktrees.sh` so a prior crashed run can't block the `add`), so the canonical checkout other agents share is never left on a feature branch.
- **Pick-up after merge.** The doctor pulls merged `main` into the canonical checkout, then runs `./scripts/server.sh verify-deployed` to confirm the checkout is a real work tree on the merged commit **before** restarting — so a silently-failed pull (e.g. a bare/misconfigured checkout) is reported as a deploy failure instead of a false "Shipped" (#419). Only on success does it restart, so the running server actually reflects the change.
- **Safe self-restart.** The doctor runs *inside* `lifeos-agent-worker`. It uses `./scripts/server.sh classify-change` to tell an API-only change (plain `lifeos-api` restart; its session survives) from an agent-worker change (which would kill it mid-run). For the latter it uses `./scripts/server.sh restart-worker-detached`, which flushes the final notice and marks the restart deliberate **before** bouncing the worker in a detached process — so the "Shipped" notice always lands and the run isn't surfaced as a spurious failure.

## Adding another orchestration bot

The doctor's machinery is generic. To add another orchestration surface, add an entry to your per-install `config/telegram_bots.local.json` (not the tracked `config/telegram_bots.json` template — see [`scripts/register_persona_bot.py`](../../scripts/register_persona_bot.py) to automate this) with `"orchestrates": true`, write its contract in `config/personas/<name>.md`, and set its `*_BOT_TOKEN`. A pure-chat specialized bot is the same minus `orchestrates` (it routes to the chat pipeline with its persona).
