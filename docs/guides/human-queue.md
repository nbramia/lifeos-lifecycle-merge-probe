# Human Queue

**Status:** Complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-07
**Audience:** Operator, Contributor

The Human queue is a shared, fire-and-forget list of things only the operator
can do — an interactive session that notices an expired login, a nightly
sync that fails on a stale credential, a Codex run that hits a decision it
can't make on its own. Any agent — interactive Claude Code, the agent
worker, `/chat`, or Hermes — can file a card without stopping, and LifeOS
itself files cards for known operator-only failures (sync errors, an
expired Monarch session).

A card is a task ([task-management](../specs/technical/task-management.md))
with tag `human` and status `blocked` — no new storage, no schema change.
A Human queue lane on the `/agents` board is that same filter — derived,
not a separate list.

## The instruction paragraph

Paste this into an operator-level instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
on a machine you run agents from) so every agent on that machine knows the
convention:

> When a conversation surfaces a task that only the operator can do — one
> the conversation itself can't finish (a credential to re-enter, an
> approval, a decision only the operator can make) — file it with
> `lifeos_human_queue_add` (a short title, notes on what's needed and why, and
> a stable `key` so re-observing the same problem updates one card instead of
> piling up duplicates). When you later see the thing done, resolve it with
> `lifeos_human_queue_resolve`. Never file work you can do yourself — file
> only what genuinely requires the operator.

The repository ships this paragraph; installing it into an operator's own
instruction files is a manual, per-install step.

## The three tools

Exposed over MCP (stdio for Claude Code, HTTP for Managed Agents and
Hermes) and as a native chat tool (`manage_human_queue`, actions
`add`/`list`/`resolve`) for `/chat`.

- **`lifeos_human_queue_add(title, notes?, key?, done_when?, source_host?, source_cwd?, source_session?)`**
  Files a card. Never blocks or changes the calling session's own status —
  purely fire-and-forget, unlike the worker's blocking
  `lifeos_agent_user_ask`. `key` must match `^[\w.:-]+\Z` (letters, digits,
  `.`, `:`, `-`, `_`) and must contain at least one character other than
  `.` — it's interpolated unescaped into the resolve route's URL path
  segment, so `/`, `?`, `#` are rejected (422). Filing again with
  an already-**open** card's `key` replaces that card's notes instead of
  creating a duplicate (`updated_at` advances). A `key` whose only match is
  a **done** card is unclaimed — filing opens a fresh card.
- **`lifeos_human_queue_resolve(id_or_key, note?)`**
  Marks the matching open card done, appending `note` to its notes body.
  404 for an id or key with no open card.
- **`lifeos_human_queue_list()`**
  Returns open cards: `id`, `title`, `key`, `age_hours`, `source_host`,
  `source_cwd`, `source_session`, `notes`, `done_when`.

## `done_when` — auto-resolve checks

The check runs only while the agent worker is running (off by default —
see [Agent Worker Setup](agent-worker-setup.md)); with the worker stopped,
a `done_when` card simply stays open until someone resolves it.

An optional condition, checked by the agent worker's poll tick
(`LIFEOS_HUMAN_QUEUE_POLL_SECONDS`, default 300s — see
[Configuration](configuration.md)) so a card resolves itself the moment the
underlying problem is actually fixed, without anyone having to remember to
go back and close it. Two types only:

```json
{"type": "endpoint", "path": "/api/example-service/status", "pointer": "/status", "equals": "ok"}
```
All three of `path`, `pointer`, and `equals` are required; `equals` must be
a JSON scalar (string, number, boolean, or null).

`path` must start with `/` and not `//`, and must not contain `?` or `#`
(422 otherwise — a worker-side guard against a `path` like `@host/x`
re-parsing the request's authority, or a query string turning the poll
into a query-driven local GET). The worker GETs `path` against the local
API it talks to, extracts the
value at the JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) `pointer`, and compares it to
`equals`. `pointer` uses the standard `/a/b` syntax (`""` or `"/"` selects
the whole response body).

```json
{"type": "file_exists", "path": "/absolute/path"}
```
Checked with a plain filesystem `exists()` call, run **in the agent-worker
process, on the worker's host** — not the API host. Those are usually the
same machine, but when `LIFEOS_API_URL` points the worker at a remote API
(see [Configuration](configuration.md)), `path` must exist on the worker's
own filesystem, not the API server's.

A card with no `done_when` just sits open until an agent (the filer, on
observing the fix, or `/chat`/Hermes on request) resolves it by hand.

A check that does not pass leaves the card untouched, retried next poll,
but logging differs: an **errored** check (endpoint unreachable, wrong
shape) logs a warning; a check that just evaluates **false** (the condition
isn't true yet) logs nothing — that's the expected steady state while the
operator hasn't acted yet. A passing check resolves the card with a note
naming the check that passed.

**Why no `shell` type.** A `done_when` check that could run an arbitrary
command would be a remote-execution surface reachable by any agent that can
file a card — deliberately excluded. `endpoint` and `file_exists` are
enough to express "the service is healthy again" or "the flag file exists"
without that risk. They are still real capability handed to any agent that
can file a card, not inert status reads: `endpoint` makes the agent worker
issue a GET against the given local API path every poll, and `file_exists`
answers whether a path exists on the worker host — so both should be
treated as available to whatever can create a `#human` task, not just to
whoever reads cards back.

## REST endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/tasks/human-queue` | File (or dedupe-update) a card |
| `GET /api/tasks/human-queue` | List open cards |
| `PUT /api/tasks/human-queue/{id_or_key}/resolve` | Resolve a card |

See [API Reference](../specs/product/api-reference.md#task-endpoints) for
request/response shapes.

## What LifeOS files for itself

- **Sync failures.** The nightly sync (`scripts/run_all_syncs.py`) files a
  card keyed `sync:<source>` for any source the run summary classifies as a
  real failure (not a disabled/unconfigured source, not a dependency skip),
  with the error text in notes. The next successful run of that source
  resolves it.
- **Monarch re-authentication.** When the cached Monarch session is
  `expired` or `missing`, the nightly sync files a card keyed
  `monarch-reauth` with a `done_when` endpoint check against
  `GET /api/monarch/session_status` (`pointer: /status`, `equals: "ok"`).
  Re-authenticating (see [Operations § Monarch Money](operations.md#monarch-money-financial-data))
  makes the worker's next tick resolve it automatically.

## In `/chat`

Asked "what's waiting on me", the orchestrator lists open cards with
`manage_human_queue` (action `list`). It can also file and resolve cards in
conversation, subject to the same "never file work you can do yourself"
rule as every other agent.

## In the morning briefing

The **Morning Briefing** proactive reminder's prompt
(`scripts/seed_proactive_reminders.py`'s `MORNING_BRIEFING_PROMPT`) has a
**Human queue** section instructing the orchestrator to call
`manage_human_queue` (action `list`) and report cards shown as 24h old or
older, skipping the section when there are none.

An existing Morning Briefing scheduler entry keeps whatever prompt text it
was seeded with; it does not pick up an edit to `MORNING_BRIEFING_PROMPT` on
its own. Re-running
`scripts/seed_proactive_reminders.py --force` does **not** update it —
`--force` only skips the by-name existence check, and `SchedulerStore.create`
always inserts a new entry, so it would leave you with two Morning Briefing
schedules. Instead, either edit the existing entry's prompt by hand to add
(or rename) a **Human queue** paragraph like the one above, or delete that
entry first and then re-run the seed script to recreate it from the current
prompt.
