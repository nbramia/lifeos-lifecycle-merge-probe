# Scripts Reference

> **Status:** Complete
> **Last Updated:** 2026-09-09
> **Audience:** Operators

Reference for the operator-facing scripts under `scripts/`, with usage examples. One-off CRM entity-repair scripts (`merge_people.py`, `split_person.py`, `fix_*`, etc.), git hooks, and Claude Code worktree/session-diagnostic helpers aren't covered here — they're self-documenting via `--help` or their own docstring.

---

## Server Management

### server.sh

Manage the LifeOS API server.

```bash
./scripts/server.sh start      # Start server (background)
./scripts/server.sh stop       # Stop server
./scripts/server.sh restart    # Restart after deploying (never for isolated test runs)
./scripts/server.sh status     # Check if running
./scripts/server.sh wait       # Wait for server to become healthy
./scripts/server.sh preflight  # Check prerequisites before first start
./scripts/server.sh foreground # Start server in foreground (for systemd)
```

**Important**: Always use this script. Never run `uvicorn` directly.

---

### chromadb.sh

Manage the ChromaDB vector database server.

```bash
./scripts/chromadb.sh start    # Start ChromaDB
./scripts/chromadb.sh stop     # Stop ChromaDB
./scripts/chromadb.sh restart  # Restart
./scripts/chromadb.sh status   # Check status
```

ChromaDB runs on port 8001.

---

## Deployment

### deploy.sh

Test, restart, commit, and push in one command.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh "Your commit message"
./scripts/deploy.sh --skip-tests "Your commit message"  # Skip tests
./scripts/deploy.sh --no-push "Your commit message"     # Commit but don't push
```

Workflow:
1. Runs `./scripts/test.sh smoke` (unless `--skip-tests`)
2. Restarts server
3. Creates git commit
4. Pushes to remote (unless `--no-push`)

---

## Testing

### test.sh

Run test suites.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh          # Unit tests only (~30s)
./scripts/test.sh smoke    # Unit + critical browser tests
./scripts/test.sh all      # Full test suite (slower)
```

### remote-test.sh

For a machine with no local venv (e.g. a MacBook that isn't the server): rsyncs your uncommitted working tree to an isolated branch-keyed directory on a remote test-runner host and runs the same `test.sh auto` scope there.

```bash
LIFEOS_REMOTE_HOST=<ssh-target> ./scripts/remote-test.sh
```

Set `LIFEOS_REMOTE_HOST` once in your shell profile — there is no default.

### Candidate CI policy audit

`scripts/candidate_ci_setup.py` audits whether GitHub can bind a required
candidate check to the trusted workflow rather than merely its display name.
It never enables the spoofable classic status-check path.

See [Candidate Verification CI](candidate-verification-ci.md) for the hosted
runner boundary and the operator rollout procedure.

### Dedicated test-runner capacity

Development test runners share one canonical per-account capacity state at
`~/.cache/lifeos/development-capacity`; neither a worktree nor a synthetic
`HOME` creates another production budget. Normal callers read its configured
total and conservative normal per-run maximum (initially total `4`, per-run
`2`). Configure it only during a host-wide quiescent maintenance window:

```bash
python scripts/test_capacity.py configure --total-workers 8 --max-run-workers 2
```

The command takes the canonical construction/acquisition lock, tries every
current slot without waiting, and refuses if any lease is active. It writes the
replacement configuration atomically only after that proof; restoring `4` is
the same operation:

```bash
python scripts/test_capacity.py configure --total-workers 4 --max-run-workers 2
```

For a reviewed dedicated invocation, the runner's explicit per-run override
may be larger than the normal cap but never larger than the configured total:

```bash
python scripts/verify_candidate.py local --source . --evidence-root /safe/evidence \
  --lanes fast-unit,browser-free --workers 8 --capacity-max-run-workers 8 \
  --parallel-browser-free
```

This is a reservation control, not proof that eight workers are safe. Retain
the CPU-only environment safeguards, source/evidence identity, detached owner,
and whole-process cleanup; do not run a large capacity benchmark until its
resource evidence and review are approved. Two genuinely concurrent jobs with
eight workers each require a separately configured total of `16`; a total of
`8` serializes them and must not be reported as concurrent throughput.

Every runner process must use the current capacity implementation: a process
that does not fence acquisition with `initialize.lock` can retain slot paths
that are unsafe for a shrink. Finish or stop every runner, update every active
worktree to this implementation, and restart those runner processes before
changing a shared host; do not shrink while any process with obsolete slot
paths could acquire. If that transition cannot be proved, leave the existing
total in place. The restoration command above requires the same quiescence and
upgrade preconditions.

---

## Sync Scripts

### run_all_syncs.py

Orchestrate all data sync operations. On Linux the nightly run is driven by the `lifeos-sync.timer` systemd timer (installed by `setup-systemd.sh`) — not a raw crontab. Check its schedule with `systemctl list-timers lifeos-sync.timer`. On macOS the equivalent is the `com.lifeos.crm-sync` launchd agent. The commands below run it manually.

```bash
# Check sync status
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --status

# Dry run (show what would run)
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --dry-run

# Execute full sync
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --execute --force

# Run specific source only
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --source gmail --force
```

**Phases**:
1. Data Collection (Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.)
2. Entity Processing (link Slack/iMessage to people)
3. Relationship Building (discover connections)
4. Vector Store Indexing (reindex vault)
5. Content Sync (Google Docs/Sheets to vault)
6. Entity Cleanup (auto-hide obvious non-human entities)
7. Consistency Verification (orphan checks, stats reconciliation)

---

### first_backfill.py

One-time deep backfill for a fresh install — run this once after initial
setup. The nightly job above deliberately narrows Gmail/Calendar to a
30-day window; this instead runs those sources (and everything else in
Phases 1-4, in the same order) at their own full-history default, then
prints a coverage report (count + earliest/latest date per source).

```bash
# Preview what would run
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/first_backfill.py --dry-run

# Run the backfill
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/first_backfill.py --execute
```

Safe to re-run — see [data-and-sync.md](../specs/technical/data-and-sync.md#first-backfill-entry-point) for details.

---

### Individual Sync Scripts

All sync scripts follow the pattern:
- Dry run by default (shows what would change)
- Use `--execute` to apply changes

#### Data Collection

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `sync_gmail_calendar_interactions.py` | Sync Gmail and Calendar |
| `sync_linkedin.py` | Import LinkedIn connections |
| `sync_contacts_csv.py` | Import Apple Contacts (CSV) |
| `sync_apple_contacts.py` | Sync Apple Contacts via direct API |
| `sync_phone_calls.py` | Sync phone call history |
| `sync_imessage_interactions.py` | Sync iMessage |
| `sync_slack.py` | Sync Slack users and DMs |
| `sync_monarch_money.py` | Sync Monarch Money financial data |

Example:
```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/sync_gmail_calendar_interactions.py --execute
```

#### Entity Processing

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `link_slack_entities.py` | Link Slack users to people by email |

| `sync_relationship_discovery.py` | Discover relationships from interactions |
| `sync_strengths.py` | Recalculate relationship strengths |
| `sync_person_stats.py` | Verify/repair interaction counts |

|--------|---------|
| `sync_entity_cleanup.py` | Auto-hide obvious non-human entities (noreply@, newsletters) |

---

## Utility Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `backup.sh` | Backup data directory |
| `setup_identity.py` | Guided first-run identity setup: search+pick yourself, your partner, and family in the vault; set work email domain(s); writes `LIFEOS_MY_PERSON_ID`/`LIFEOS_PARTNER_NAME`/`LIFEOS_WORK_DOMAIN*` to `.env` and merges `config/family_members.json`/`config/relationship_overrides.json`. Run once, after the first sync/index — requires the API server up. |
| `monarch_reauth.py` | Non-interactive Monarch Money MFA re-auth (the interactive `interactive_login` flow needs a real TTY, which agent shells don't have) — see [operations.md](operations.md#monarch-money-financial-data). |
| `chromadb-watchdog.sh` | ChromaDB health check and auto-restart |
| `gpu-watchdog.sh` | Alerts via Telegram when GPU VRAM usage crosses a threshold, to catch impending OOM lockups before an embedding-heavy sync triggers one. Linux only (AMDGPU sysfs). Installed as `lifeos-gpu-watchdog.timer` by `setup-systemd.sh`. |
| `server-watchdog.sh` | Detects and restarts a stuck/duplicated API server (duplicate uvicorn processes, unresponsive after long syncs). Installed as `lifeos-server-watchdog.timer` by `setup-systemd.sh`; on macOS, run from a cron entry via the `LifeOS.app` FDA wrapper. |
| `network-watchdog.sh` | WiFi link health check and self-heal (re-activate → bounce radio → reload driver → restart NetworkManager) |
| `auto-deploy.sh` | Poll `origin/main`; on a fast-forward advance, pull and restart the code services that changed. Pull-based, guarded (main branch + clean tree + `--ff-only`), opt-in via `LIFEOS_AUTODEPLOY_ENABLED`. Run by `lifeos-autodeploy.timer`. |
| `auto-update-macos.sh` | The macOS analog of `auto-deploy.sh` for the launchd-managed API service. Same opt-in flag and guards; not installed as a timer by this repo — an operator adds their own cron/launchd entry. See [Auto-Deploy on macOS](operations.md#auto-deploy-on-macos-self-hosted-redeploy) in operations.md. |
| `cleanup-worktrees.sh` | Idempotent git-worktree pruning plus targeted removal of a stale worktree/branch; safe to call pre-flight before `git worktree add`. |
| `migrate_reminders_to_scheduler.py` | One-shot, idempotent migration of the legacy `~/.lifeos/reminders.json` store into the Scheduler's `Inbox.md` source of truth. Non-destructive (keeps the JSON as backup). |
| `install_codex_skills.py` | Convert portable LifeOS skills from `.claude/skills/` into Codex's `SKILL.md` format into `~/.codex/skills/`. Re-run after editing source skills. |
| `register_persona_bot.py` | Safely register a new persona Telegram bot: appends its token/chat-id env vars to `.env` (append-only — a symlinked `.env` stays a symlink) and adds it to `config/telegram_bots.local.json` (seeded from the template on first use). Does not register the bot with @BotFather or restart the service — see [personas.md](personas.md#create-your-own-persona). |
| `create-lifeos-app.sh` | Create the `LifeOS.app` Full Disk Access wrapper bundle in `/Applications` (macOS only), the FDA container cron/launchd route through for protected databases. |
| `lifeos-agent-hook.sh` | Claude Code / Codex session-lifecycle hook — posts session_start/user_prompt_submit/stop/session_end to `POST /api/agents/cli-sessions/events` from any machine, so `/agents` shows sessions from every machine, not just this one. Installed by `install-agent-hooks.sh`; see [agents-go-to.md § 4](agents-go-to.md#4-cross-machine-session-registration). |
| `install-agent-hooks.sh` | Idempotently installs `lifeos-agent-hook.sh` into `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`. Run once per machine; safe to re-run. |
| `preflight.sh` | Pre-flight checks (called by server.sh) |
| `run_sync_wrapper.sh` | NVMe wake + pre-flight for nightly sync |
| `run_sync_with_fda.sh` | FDA wrapper for phone/iMessage sync (macOS) |
| `run_fda_syncs.py` | Python FDA sync orchestrator (macOS) |
| `apple_data_export.py` | Export Apple data (iMessage, Contacts, Photos) on macOS |
| `apple_data_import.py` | Import Apple data exports on the server |
| `apple_data_agent.sh` | Apple Data Agent orchestrator (runs on macOS, rsyncs to server) |

---

## Service Management

### service.sh

Manage system services (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS).

```bash
./scripts/service.sh install    # Install and start the service (auto-start on boot)
./scripts/service.sh uninstall  # Stop and remove the service
./scripts/service.sh start      # Start the service
./scripts/service.sh stop       # Stop the service
./scripts/service.sh restart    # Restart the service
./scripts/service.sh status     # Check service status and health
./scripts/service.sh logs       # Tail the service logs
```

---

### setup-systemd.sh

Configure systemd services on Linux. Reads toggles from `.env`, substitutes templates from `config/systemd/`, then enables and starts the units. Re-run after changing any autostart toggle in `.env`.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
```

Installs and enables:

- **Services** — `lifeos-api`, `lifeos-chromadb`, `lifeos-llm` (local LLM; enabled only when `LIFEOS_LOCAL_LLM_AUTOSTART=true`), `lifeos-mcp-http` (enabled only when `LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` is set), `lifeos-agent-worker` (enabled only when `LIFEOS_AGENT_WORKER_AUTOSTART=true`).
- **Timers** — `lifeos-watchdog`, `lifeos-server-watchdog`, `lifeos-gpu-watchdog`, `lifeos-network-watchdog`, `lifeos-sync` (nightly unified sync), and `lifeos-autodeploy` (enabled only when `LIFEOS_AUTODEPLOY_ENABLED=true`).
- **Supporting config** — a logrotate rule (`/etc/logrotate.d/lifeos`), a passwordless-`systemctl` sudoers rule (`/etc/sudoers.d/lifeos`) so `server.sh` and the sync scripts can manage units without a password, and an 8 GB swap file as an OOM safety net (created only if no swap is already active).

---

### setup-launchd.sh

Configure launchd services from templates (macOS only). Interactive: prompts for the vault path (or accepts it as an optional argument, or falls back to `LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH` in `.env` under `--yes`), generates plist files from `config/launchd/` templates, and installs them to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`. ChromaDB is intentionally skipped — use a cron watchdog for it (see [launchd-setup.md](launchd-setup.md)).

Installs, conditionally, the same two services `setup-systemd.sh` gates on Linux — **agent-worker** (only when `LIFEOS_AGENT_WORKER_AUTOSTART=true`) and **MCP HTTP** (only when `LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` is set) — using the same env vars, so one `.env` controls both platforms identically (#774). Neither is generated-and-skipped like ChromaDB; with its flag unset, no plist for it is installed at all. The GPU and network watchdogs have no macOS equivalent (different hardware/driver entirely) — the run prints them as explicitly skipped, not silence, at the end.

Re-running never silently replaces a differently-configured, already-installed plist: if the generated content differs from what's on disk, the existing file is backed up to `config/launchd/backups/` before being overwritten, with a `WARNING` line naming what happened.

```bash
./scripts/setup-launchd.sh                 # prompts for vault path
./scripts/setup-launchd.sh ~/Notes --yes   # pass vault path, skip confirmation
```

---

### setup-tailscale.sh

Expose LifeOS on the tailnet HTTPS front (port 443) via `tailscale serve`, so `/chat` voice works (the mic needs a secure context). Reverse-proxies to the local API; whisper-relay stays on localhost. Reads `LIFEOS_PORT` / `TAILNET_HTTPS_URL` from the environment.

```bash
./scripts/setup-tailscale.sh
```

---

### install-systemd-tailscale.sh

Generate a `--user` systemd unit (`lifeos-tailscale.service`) that runs `setup-tailscale.sh` once the API is healthy, so the Tailscale Serve proxy survives reboot.

```bash
./scripts/install-systemd-tailscale.sh
systemctl --user enable --now lifeos-tailscale.service
```

---

## Authentication

### google_auth.py

Authenticate with Google OAuth.

```bash
# Personal account
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/google_auth.py --account personal

# Work account
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/google_auth.py --account work
```

Opens browser for Google sign-in, saves token to configured path.

---

## Maintenance

### Manual API Triggers

These operations can also be triggered via API:

```bash
# Reindex vault (background)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex

# Reindex vault (blocking)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex/sync

# Trigger calendar sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/calendar/sync

# Trigger relationship discovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/crm/relationships/discover

# Update relationship strengths
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/crm/strengths/update
```

---

## Script Patterns

### Common Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--execute` | Apply changes (default is dry run) |
| `--force` | Skip "already ran today" checks |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without changes |
| `--source X` | Run only specific source |

### Environment

Scripts expect:
- `~/.venvs/lifeos` on the server
- `.env` file with configuration
- ChromaDB running for vector operations
- Server running for API-based operations

### Logs

Sync logs go to:
- stdout/stderr during execution
- `logs/crm-sync.log` when run via systemd/launchd
- `~/Notes/LifeOS/sync_errors.md` for error summaries

---

## Examples

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: check status
./scripts/server.sh status
curl http://localhost:8000/health/full | jq

# After code changes
./scripts/server.sh restart
./scripts/test.sh

# Ready to commit
./scripts/deploy.sh "Add new feature"
```

### Debug a Sync Issue

```bash
# Check what ran
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --status

# Run specific source with debug output
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/sync_gmail_calendar_interactions.py --execute 2>&1 | tee debug.log

# Check for errors
cat ~/Notes/LifeOS/sync_errors.md
```

### Force Full Reindex

```bash
# Stop server
./scripts/server.sh stop

# Clear and rebuild (optional, destructive)
rm -rf data/chromadb/lifeos_*
rm data/chromadb/bm25_index.db

# Start server
./scripts/server.sh start

# Trigger full reindex
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex/sync
```
