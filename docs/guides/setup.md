## Phase 0: System Evaluation

Determine hardware capabilities to select appropriate models.

```bash
# Linux:
free -h
lscpu
uname -a

# macOS:
sysctl hw.memsize | awk '{print $2/1073741824 " GB RAM"}'
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Chip\|Total Number of Cores\|Memory"
sw_vers
```

The orchestration/synthesis LLM runs on the **Anthropic backend by default** (Claude
via API — no local GPU needed). The embedding model runs locally regardless. Based on
available RAM, recommend an embedding + reranker configuration:

| RAM | Embedding Model | Reranker |
|-----|----------------|----------|
| 8 GB | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim) | disabled |
| 16 GB | `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim, default) | enabled |
| 32 GB+ | `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim, default) | enabled |
| 64 GB+ (GPU) | `Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct` (1536-dim, upgrade) | enabled |

The default embedding model is `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim).
`Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct` (1536-dim) is a recommended upgrade for capable
hardware. On 8 GB, drop to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

A **fully-local LLM** (llama-server instead of the Anthropic backend) is an optional
alternative for 64 GB+ GPU systems — see [Installation → Local LLM](installation.md#local-llm-optional).

**[ASK USER]** Present the recommended configuration and confirm before proceeding.

Record the chosen models — they'll be set in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites

Check each prerequisite:

```bash
python3 --version   # Need 3.11+
git --version       # Need git

# Linux: ensure pip and venv are available
# Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
# Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-pip

# macOS: Homebrew recommended
brew --version
```

**Note (macOS):** If Homebrew is not installed, the user must install it manually in a terminal
(it requires interactive `sudo`). Tell them to run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If Python 3.11+ is missing:
```bash
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt install python3.12
# macOS:
brew install python@3.12
```

**[VERIFY]** Python is 3.11 or higher and git is available.

---

## Phase 2: Virtual Environment

Create the venv outside the project directory. This is a convention that also avoids macOS TCC scanning delays if running on macOS.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.venvs
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/lifeos
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**[VERIFY]** Confirm key packages are installed:

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/pip show sentence-transformers fastapi chromadb | grep -E "^Name:|^Version:"
```

All three packages should be listed.

---

## Phase 3: Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**[ASK USER]** Collect the following values:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH` | Yes | Absolute path to Obsidian vault |
| `LIFEOS_USER_NAME` | Yes | First name (used in prompts) |
| `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND` | No | `anthropic` (default, uses Claude API) or `local` (uses llama-server — needs a high-VRAM GPU) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes on default backend | Claude API key (starts with `sk-ant-`); required unless `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=local` |
| `LIFEOS_PARTNER_NAME` | No | Partner's first name (leave empty to skip) |
| `LIFEOS_TIMEZONE` | No | IANA timezone (default: `America/New_York`) |

**[ASK USER]** Which optional integrations do you want to set up? (All can be added later.)

- **Google OAuth** — Calendar, Gmail, Drive sync (personal account)
- **Google OAuth (work)** — Separate work account for Calendar/Gmail (supports up to 2 work accounts)
- **Monarch Money** — Financial data (account balances, transactions, budgets)
- **Telegram bot** — Chat interface and push notifications
- **Slack** — Workspace message sync
- **LinkedIn** — Connections enrichment (company, position) from a manual
  "Get a copy of your data" CSV export — no OAuth
- **WhatsApp** — Chat history sync via `wacli` on a paired Apple Data Agent Mac (the LifeOS
  host runs on Linux; wacli is macOS-only). Data is exported into
  `data/apple-imports/whatsapp.json` and rsynced alongside contacts/iMessage.
- **MCP for Claude Code** — Use LifeOS as a tool from Claude Code/Desktop

Record the selections — they'll be configured in Phase 10.

If the user wants **Google OAuth (work)**, also collect:
- `LIFEOS_WORK_DOMAIN` — their work email domain (e.g., `acme.com`)
- Set `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK_GMAIL=true` and/or `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK_CALENDAR=true` as desired
- For a second work account: `LIFEOS_WORK_DOMAIN_2`, `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK2_GMAIL`, `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK2_CALENDAR`

If the user wants **Monarch Money**, collect:
- `MONARCH_EMAIL` — Monarch Money account email
- `MONARCH_PASSWORD` — Monarch Money account password

Set all collected values in `.env`. Then set model overrides from Phase 0:

- If 8 GB RAM:
  ```
  LIFEOS_EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2
  LIFEOS_RERANKER_ENABLED=false
  ```
- If 16–32 GB RAM: defaults are fine, no overrides needed (embedding stays `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`).
- If 64 GB+ with GPU (upgrade):
  ```
  LIFEOS_EMBEDDING_MODEL=Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct
  ```

The default LLM backend is `anthropic`, so leave `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND` unset (or set it
to `anthropic`) and provide `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `OLLAMA_*` variables are legacy and
ignored — do not set them.

**[VERIFY]** `.env` contains `LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH` with a real value (and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unless using the `local` backend):

```bash
grep -E "^LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH=|^LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=|^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env
```

---

## Phase 4: Config Files

Copy example configs to their active names:

```bash
cp config/crm_mappings.yaml.example config/crm_mappings.yaml
cp config/linkedin_industry_mappings.json.example config/linkedin_industry_mappings.json
cp config/people_dictionary.example.json config/people_dictionary.json
cp config/family_members.example.json config/family_members.json
```

Then personalize the two people-related files:

**[ASK USER]** What is your first name? (Used to exclude self from entity extraction.)

Edit `config/people_dictionary.json` — replace the placeholder self entry with the
user's first name (as `canonical`) and lowercase aliases, keeping `"category": "self"`
and `"exclude": true`.

**[ASK USER]** What is your family last name? (Used for family member detection.)

Edit `config/family_members.json` — add the user's family last name (lowercase) to
`family_last_names`.

**[VERIFY]** All config files exist:

```bash
ls config/crm_mappings.yaml config/linkedin_industry_mappings.json config/people_dictionary.json config/family_members.json
```

---

## Phase 5: Services

### Start ChromaDB

```bash
./scripts/chromadb.sh start
```

Verify ChromaDB is healthy:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v2/heartbeat
```

### Start the LifeOS server

```bash
./scripts/server.sh start
```

**Note:** LifeOS is designed to run its API server on exactly one machine; every
other machine should be a client pointed at it via `LIFEOS_API_URL`, not run its
own copy of the server. If you have multiple machines and want to enforce this,
set `LIFEOS_SERVER_HOSTNAME=<your-host>` (the output of `hostname` on the
designated machine) in `.env` — the server then refuses to start anywhere else.
Leave it unset for a single-machine setup; the default never blocks a start.

**[VERIFY]** All services are healthy:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/full | python3 -m json.tool
```

All services should show healthy status, with ChromaDB connected.

---

## Phase 6: First Index

Trigger the initial vault index. The embedding model will be downloaded automatically
on first run (~300MB for the default model, ~90MB for all-MiniLM-L6-v2). This is expected.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/admin/reindex/sync | python3 -m json.tool
```

This may take several minutes depending on vault size. Wait for it to complete.

Then test search:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test", "top_k": 5}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

**[VERIFY]** Search returns results from the vault. If the vault has content, `results` should be non-empty.

---

## Phase 7: Person ID Setup

**Note:** Person entities are created during data syncs (contacts, email, calendar), not
during vault indexing. On a fresh install, the CRM will be empty after Phase 6.

Skip this phase for now. After running the first full sync (Phase 8 or manually via
`~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/run_all_syncs.py --execute`), come back and complete
this step:

Look up the user's person entity ID:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/crm/people?q=FIRST_NAME" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for p in data.get('people', []):
    print(f\"{p['id']}  {p['name']}\")
"
```

**[ASK USER]** Confirm which entry is them.

Add their person ID to `.env`:

```
LIFEOS_MY_PERSON_ID=the-id-from-above
```

Restart the server:

```bash
./scripts/server.sh restart
```

**[VERIFY]** Server is healthy after restart:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/full | python3 -m json.tool
```

---

## Phase 8: System Services (optional)

**[ASK USER]** Do you want to configure LifeOS to run automatically on boot?

### Linux (systemd)

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
```

**[VERIFY]** systemd services are active:

```bash
systemctl status lifeos-api lifeos-chromadb
```

### macOS (launchd)

> **Note:** launchd is macOS-only and superseded by systemd on Linux — see
> [ADR-007: Linux Migration](../adr/007-linux-migration.md). Use this only on a macOS host.

`setup-launchd.sh` accepts an optional `[vault_path] [--yes]` and is interactive when you omit them — it prompts for the vault path:

```bash
./scripts/setup-launchd.sh
```

Set up the ChromaDB cron watchdog:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * pgrep -f 'chroma run' || (cd $(pwd) && ./scripts/chromadb.sh start)") | crontab -
```

**[VERIFY]** launchd services are loaded:

```bash
launchctl list | grep lifeos
```

---

## Phase 9: FDA Wrapper (macOS Apple Data Agent only)

> **Note:** This phase applies only to macOS machines running the Apple Data Agent.
> On Linux, Apple data is imported via `apple_data_import.py` from nightly rsync exports.
> The design rationale (why a `.app` wrapper, why cron, why rsync, what fails when) is captured in [ADR-010: Apple Data Agent](../adr/010-apple-data-agent.md).

Phone calls, FaceTime, and iMessage sync **require Full Disk Access** to read system
databases. Without this phase, those data sources will not sync.

**[ASK USER]** Do you want to set up phone/iMessage sync?

If yes:

### Create the app bundle

```bash
./scripts/create-lifeos-app.sh --force
```

### Grant Full Disk Access

**[ASK USER]** The user must do these steps manually in System Settings:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Full Disk Access**
2. Click `+` and add `/Applications/LifeOS.app`
3. Also ensure **Terminal.app** has Full Disk Access (it's in `/Applications/Utilities/`)

### Add the cron job for nightly FDA sync

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "50 2 * * * /Applications/LifeOS.app/Contents/MacOS/LifeOS fda-sync") | crontab -
```

This runs at 2:50 AM, 10 minutes before the main nightly sync.

**[VERIFY]** The app bundle exists and is executable:

```bash
/Applications/LifeOS.app/Contents/MacOS/LifeOS watchdog
```

---

## Phase 10: Optional Integrations

Set up the integrations selected in Phase 3. Skip any that weren't selected.

### Google OAuth — Personal (Calendar, Gmail, Drive)

Follow [google-oauth.md](google-oauth.md). Key steps:
1. Create Google Cloud project and enable Calendar/Gmail/Drive APIs
2. Configure OAuth consent screen and **publish the app** (Audience → Publish)
3. Create OAuth credentials, save as `config/credentials-personal.json`
4. Run: `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/google_auth.py --account personal`

### Google OAuth — Work (Calendar, Gmail)

If the user selected work Google account in Phase 3:
1. Create a **separate** Google Cloud project for the work account
2. Follow the same OAuth setup steps as personal
3. Save credentials as `config/credentials-work.json`
4. Run: `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/google_auth.py --account work`
5. Verify `LIFEOS_WORK_DOMAIN`, `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK_GMAIL`, and/or `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK_CALENDAR`
   are set in `.env` (should already be from Phase 3)

For a **second work account**, repeat with `--account work2`:
1. Save credentials as `config/credentials-work2.json`
2. Run: `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/google_auth.py --account work2`
3. Set `LIFEOS_WORK_DOMAIN_2`, `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK2_GMAIL`, `LIFEOS_SYNC_WORK2_CALENDAR` in `.env`

### Telegram Bot

1. Create a bot via @BotFather on Telegram
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to `.env`
3. Restart: `./scripts/server.sh restart`

### Slack

1. Set up workspace OAuth
2. Add `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` to `.env`
3. Restart: `./scripts/server.sh restart`

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn connections import from a manual CSV export — there's no API/OAuth step.

1. On linkedin.com: **Settings & Privacy → Data privacy → Get a copy of your data**
2. Select "Connections" and request the export (LinkedIn emails you a download link,
   usually within a few minutes)
3. Unzip the download and place `Connections.csv` at `data/LinkedInConnections.csv`
   (the path `scripts/sync_linkedin.py` reads by default — override with
   `--csv <path>` if you'd rather keep it elsewhere)
4. Re-run the export periodically (e.g. every few months) to pick up new connections —
   nothing re-fetches this automatically

If the CSV is absent, the nightly sync reports LinkedIn as cleanly skipped rather
than failing or silently doing nothing.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp sync runs on the Apple Data Agent side of the pipeline — the Linux
LifeOS host does not touch wacli directly. These steps must be run on
whichever Mac plays the Apple Data Agent role (any spare Mac with FDA
granted works), which rsyncs `data/apple-imports/` to the Linux server.

On the Apple Data Agent Mac:

1. Install: `brew install openclaw/tap/wacli`. If `steipete/tap/wacli` is
   already tapped, untap it first — a stale tap silently disables
   `brew outdated`, so it won't warn you the client is out of date.
2. Authenticate: `wacli auth` (scan the QR code with WhatsApp → Linked Devices)
3. Verify: `wacli chats list --limit 5`
4. Confirm the exporter picks up WhatsApp:
   `~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/apple_data_export.py --execute --source whatsapp`
   should produce `data/apple-imports/whatsapp.json`.

On the Linux host, no configuration is needed — the `apple_import` sync step
already imports `whatsapp.json` through `scripts/apple_data_import.py`. If the
Mac side can't run wacli (e.g. not installed, not authenticated), the manifest
marks WhatsApp as `status: "error"`, the Linux importer logs CRITICAL, and
`sync_health` records the apple_import run as FAILED so you get alerted.

### MCP for Claude Code

**Note:** This command must be run in a separate terminal, not from within Claude Code.
Point it at your LifeOS checkout (uses stdio transport):

```bash
claude mcp add lifeos -- ~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python ~/LifeOS/mcp_server.py
```

### Monarch Money (Financial Data)

`MONARCH_EMAIL` and `MONARCH_PASSWORD` should already be set in `.env` from Phase 3.
Now run the interactive MFA authentication (a code will be sent via email/SMS):

**[ASK USER]** The user needs to be ready to enter an MFA code from their email/phone.

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney
mm = MonarchMoney()
asyncio.run(mm.interactive_login())
mm.save_session('data/monarch_session.pickle')
print('Session saved!')
"
```

Restart: `./scripts/server.sh restart`

Each integration can be added later. None are required for core functionality.

---

## Done

LifeOS is running. Core functionality available:

- Semantic search: `POST /api/search`
- Chat: `POST /api/chat`
- CRM: `GET /api/crm/people`
- Health: `GET /health/full`

**Remember:** Come back to Phase 7 after the first full sync to set your person ID.

For ongoing maintenance, see the project `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`.
