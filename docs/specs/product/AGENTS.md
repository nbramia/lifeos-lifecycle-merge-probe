This directory contains product specifications — what the system does from a consumer perspective.

## Key Principles

- Product specs describe **WHAT** (consumer view) — feature behavior, API contracts, semantics. Implementation details belong in `technical/`. If you find yourself describing route handlers, schema, or library internals, that content should move.
- Data model specs define what entities *mean* and how they relate. Structural details (SQLite schema, ChromaDB collections, indexes) go in `technical/`.
- API contracts describe the consumer-facing shape (path, parameters, response schema). Route-handler structure and middleware go in `technical/`.
- Every product spec must include frontmatter: `Status`, `Last Updated`, `Owner`.
