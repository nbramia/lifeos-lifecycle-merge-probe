# CRM API Reference

**Status:** Complete
**Owner:** API Gateway
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-05

Every `/api/crm/*` HTTP endpoint. Split out of the main [api-reference.md](api-reference.md) because the CRM endpoint catalog is large enough to deserve its own file. For the consumer view of the CRM features these endpoints back, see the [CRM specs](crm-ui.md).

`GET /api/crm/people` (only for the default page shape — no search text, `limit` ≤ 300), `/statistics`, `/me/interactions`, `/me/timeline`, `/family/interactions`, `/family/timeline`, and `/birthdays/all` are backed by a short-lived, data-version-keyed response cache — see [architecture.md](../technical/architecture.md) for how it's keyed and invalidated. Response shape and status codes are unchanged. Freshness is bounded by a five-minute TTL rather than guaranteed immediate: a write to the CRM data invalidates a cached response well within that window, but a response can otherwise be up to five minutes old, and a time-windowed aggregate (computed from the request time) freezes "now" for the life of the cached entry that served it.

## People

### GET /api/crm/people

List/search people with filters.

**Query parameters:**
- `q` (string): Search query (name, email, company)
- `category` (string): work, personal, family
- `source` (string): gmail, calendar, slack, etc.
- `dunbar_circles` (string): Comma-separated Dunbar circles, e.g. `5,6+`
- `tags` (string): Comma-separated tags; person must have at least one
- `has_interactions` (bool): Filter by interaction count > 0
- `min_interactions` (int, default 0): Minimum total interactions (emails + meetings + mentions + messages)
- `sort` (string, default `strength`): `interactions`, `last_seen`, `name`, `strength`
- `offset` (int, default 0): Pagination offset
- `limit` (int, 1–10000, default 50): Results per page

Each returned person carries `has_profile_photo` (bool, from `photo_count > 0`) alongside the usual fields, so a client can request `GET /api/photos/profile/{id}` only for people flagged true instead of probing everyone. `GET /api/crm/people/{id}` carries the same field for consistency.

### GET /api/crm/people/{id}

Get person detail with source entities.

### GET /api/crm/people/{id}/timeline

Chronological interaction history.

**Query parameters:**
- `source_type` (string): Filter by source

### GET /api/crm/people/{id}/connections

Related people with overlap scores.

**Query parameters:**
- `relationship_type` (string): Filter by type (e.g., "coworker")

**Response:**
```json
{
  "connections": [
    {

## Contact Sources, Split, Merge

### GET /api/crm/people/{id}/contact-sources

**Recommended for split UI.** Get aggregated contact sources (emails, phones, etc.) linked to a person.

Contact sources are the meaningful units for entity splitting — each represents a unique identifier (email address, phone number) rather than individual messages.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "person_id": "uuid",
  "person_name": "Alex Chen",
  "total_contact_sources": 2,
  "total_observations": 49986,
  "contact_sources": [
    {
      "identifier": "alex.chen@example.com",
      "identifier_type": "email",
      "source_types": ["gmail", "calendar", "contacts"],
      "observation_count": 49984,
      "source_entity_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "..."],
      "observed_names": ["Alex Chen", "Alex"],
      "first_seen": "2024-01-15T...",
      "last_seen": "2023-01-29T..."
    },
    {
      "identifier": "+15550123",
      "identifier_type": "phone",
      "source_types": ["imessage", "whatsapp"],
      "observation_count": 2,
      "source_entity_ids": ["uuid3", "uuid4"],
      "observed_names": ["Alex"],
      "first_seen": "2024-06-01T...",
      "last_seen": "2023-01-28T..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Identifier types:**
- `email` — Email address (appears in gmail, calendar, contacts, etc.)
- `phone` — Phone number in E.164 format (appears in imessage, whatsapp, phone)
- `slack_user` — Slack workspace user ID
- `linkedin_profile` — LinkedIn profile URL
- `name_only` — Vault/Granola mentions with no email/phone

### POST /api/crm/people/split

Split source entities from one person to another.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "from_person_id": "uuid",
  "to_person_id": "uuid",
  "new_person_name": "New Person",
  "source_entity_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  "create_overrides": true
}
```

Exactly one of `to_person_id` and `new_person_name` is supplied.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "from_person_id": "uuid",
  "to_person_id": "uuid",
  "source_entities_moved": 5,
  "interactions_moved": 10,
  "overrides_created": 2
}
```

### GET /api/crm/link-overrides

List disambiguation rules that prevent future entity mis-linking.

### DELETE /api/crm/link-overrides/{id}

Delete a link override rule.

### POST /api/crm/people/merge

Merge two person records. Combines all interactions, relationships, and source entities from the secondary person into the primary person.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "primary_id": "uuid",
  "secondary_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "primary_id": "uuid",
  "merged_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  "stats": {
    "interactions_updated": 156,
    "source_entities_updated": 12,
    "emails_merged": 3,
    "phones_merged": 1,
    "aliases_added": 2
  }
}
```

## Relationships and Graph

### GET /api/crm/network

Network graph data (nodes + edges). With `center_on`, this is a bounded
neighborhood — the strongest connections within `depth` hops, capped by
`max_nodes`, `max_second_degree_per_node`, and `max_edges` — not the full
relationship table (see
[crm-graph.md § Bounded Neighborhood](crm-graph.md#bounded-neighborhood)).

**Query parameters:**
- `center_on` (string): Person ID to center on. Required unless `allow_full_graph=true`.
- `depth` (int, 1–4, default 2): Graph depth
- `min_strength` (float, 0.0–1.0, default 0.0): Minimum node relationship strength, applied against `relationship_strength` on its 0–100 scale. Since the parameter itself is only accepted up to 1.0, the only nodes it can drop are those with a `relationship_strength` below 1.0 (in practice, strength-0 nodes).
- `category` (string): Filter by category. Best-effort for a centered request — see the docs linked above.
- `max_nodes` (int, 1–500, default 150): Total nodes in the response, including the center
- `max_second_degree_per_node` (int, 0–50, default 10): Second-(and deeper-)degree neighbors added per node at the previous depth
- `max_edges` (int, 1–20000, default 2000): Target maximum edges; every edge touching the center is always included even if that alone exceeds this
- `allow_full_graph` (bool, default false): Opt-in to load every person and relationship (no `center_on`); ignores the three caps above

**Response includes edge source breakdown:**
- `shared_events_count`
- `shared_threads_count`
- `shared_messages_count`
- `shared_whatsapp_count`
- `shared_slack_count`
- `is_linkedin_connection`

### GET /api/crm/relationship/{person_a_id}/{person_b_id}

Detailed edge data between two people.

### POST /api/crm/relationships/discover

Trigger full relationship discovery. Scans interactions to find/update relationships between people.

  "relationships_created": 45,
  "relationships_updated": 120
}
```

---

## Facts

### GET /api/crm/people/{id}/facts

Get extracted facts about a person (auto-extracted from interactions).

**Response:**

  "person_id": "uuid",
  "person_name": "Alex Chen",
  "facts": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "category": "work",
      "content": "Works at Example Corp as VP Engineering",
      "confidence": 0.9,

---

## Config

### GET /api/crm/config

**Response fields:**
- `photos_enabled` (bool): Whether Apple Photos is configured on this install. The frontend uses this to decide whether to request avatar/profile photos at all, gated the same as `has_profile_photo` on person list cards — see [crm-people.md](crm-people.md).

---

## Me Dashboard

### GET /api/crm/me/stats

Aggregate statistics for the owner's personal dashboard. Returns total people, emails, meetings, and messages across the CRM.

### GET /api/crm/me/timeline

Chronological interaction history for the owner. Returns ALL interactions across all people (since all interactions involve the owner).

**Query parameters:**
- `source_type` (string): Filter by source type (comma-separated for compound filters)
- `days_back` (int): Lookback period (default: 365)
- `date` (string): Filter to specific date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `offset` (int): Pagination offset
- `limit` (int): Max results (default: 50)

### GET /api/crm/me/interactions

Aggregated interaction data for the "Me" dashboard. Returns pre-aggregated data for heatmaps, charts, trends, network growth, and messaging volume by Dunbar circle.

**Query parameters:**
- `days_back` (int): Days of history (default: 365, max: 3660)
- `trend_period` (string): Trend comparison period (week, month, quarter, year)
- `health_period` (string): Health score history period (month, quarter, year)

### GET /api/crm/me/interactions/span

Earliest and latest interaction dates (excluding self, hidden, and peripheral people — the same population `/me/interactions` aggregates) plus a suggested heatmap year count clamped to 1–10. The Me page calls this first to size its heatmap window instead of requesting a fixed 10 years and shrinking the display afterward.

```json
{
  "earliest": "2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00",
  "latest": "2026-09-04T12:00:00+00:00",
  "years": 10
}
```

`earliest`/`latest` are `null` when there is no data.

**Query parameters:**
- `person_ids` (string): Comma-separated person IDs
- `days_back` (int): Days of history

### GET /api/crm/family/channel-mix

## Tone Analysis

### POST /api/crm/relationship/tone-analysis

Compact monthly tone summary for `person_id`: one combined (user+partner average) score per month in the window, plus a trend and average. Backed by the same persisted store, chunked-LLM pipeline, and per-person lock as the detailed endpoint below -- both share one implementation, so freshness, staleness, and failure semantics are identical between them. Like the detailed endpoint, the pipeline reads `source_type="imessage"` only -- a person whose history is WhatsApp/Slack/phone only can never have a scored month here.

With `compute=false` (the default) this never calls the LLM: it reads only what's already persisted, at the cost of one lightweight per-month count query. `compute=true` runs the same stale-month recompute pass the detailed endpoint uses before reading back. Either way it never returns a 500 for an LLM failure or unavailability.

**Query parameters:**
- `person_id` (string, optional): Target person (defaults to partner)
- `months` (int): Months to analyze (default: 12)
- `compute` (bool, optional): Recompute any stale or missing month before responding (default: false)

**Response:** `monthly_tones` carries the same months, in the same order, as the detailed endpoint -- including a month with no stored result at all, which gets a placeholder score and `"status": "error"`, exactly like the detailed endpoint's own convention (a stale month instead gets its last stored score and `"status": "stale"`). `trend` and `average` are derived only from the non-`"error"` months; `average` and `analyzed_through` are `null` when none exist.

A top-level `status` field names this request's own outcome:
- `"ok"`: at least one month has a real score, or none do but nothing was ever attempted (the ordinary not-yet-analyzed state).
- `"no-messages"`: no analyzable iMessage interactions anywhere in the window.
- `"in-progress"` (`compute=true` only): another request for this person already held the per-person lock and this one timed out waiting for it.
- `"failed"` (`compute=true` only): the lock was acquired, every stale month's LLM call failed or was unavailable, and nothing was ever stored for this person.

`person_id` defaults to the configured partner when omitted; an unconfigured partner and an unrecognized `person_id` both resolve to no interactions in the window (`status: "no-messages"`) rather than a 404.

### POST /api/crm/relationship/tone-analysis-detailed

Detailed tone analysis with separate scores for the user and their partner. Messages are bucketed by calendar month first, then by week within that month (so a week straddling a month boundary is never double-counted), and each stale month gets one overall score per person.

Results are persisted per person and month (see [crm-analytics.md](crm-analytics.md#tone-analysis-apis)). Freshness is checked with a lightweight per-month count query that loads no interaction rows, so a fully-cached response touches storage only and returns in well under 200ms regardless of how many interactions exist in the window; only when at least one month is stale does the handler load and bucket the actual messages. Stale months are recomputed in one or more LLM calls, chunked at a handful of months per call so a single slow or timed-out call can't affect the whole window, and every chunk's result is saved as soon as it completes. Concurrent requests for the same person are serialized (with a short timeout) so two open tabs don't both pay for the same call.

**Query parameters:**
- `person_id` (string, optional): Target person (defaults to partner)
- `months` (int): Months to analyze (default: 12)
- `refresh` (bool, optional): Force recomputation of every month in the window, bypassing the freshness cache (default: false)

**Response:** a stale month that couldn't be recomputed this request (the LLM failed, was unavailable, or its response omitted that month) is never discarded -- it comes back with its last stored score and `"status": "stale"` if one exists, or `"status": "error"` (a neutral placeholder score, not a real one) only when nothing was ever stored for it. `null`/omitted status means the score is current. The Relationship page's Tone Evolution chart plots a stale month as a dimmed point and an error month as a gap with a "not analysed" marker.
