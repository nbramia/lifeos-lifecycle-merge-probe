# Claude Code Orchestration

**Status:** Complete
**Owner:** Orchestrator
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-09

LifeOS spawns a **Claude Code** subprocess from Telegram when the operator sends `/claude <task>` (or when a natural-language message is classified as requiring terminal / filesystem / browser access). The subprocess runs the task on the server, streams progress back as Telegram messages, and terminates. The operator can monitor (`/claude_status`) and cancel (`/claude_cancel`) the active session.

This spec covers the consumer view — what the operator sees and controls. For implementation see [technical/claude-code-orchestration.md](../technical/claude-code-orchestration.md). For operator setup (binary install, `setup-token`, troubleshooting) see [guides/claude-code-orchestration.md](../../guides/claude-code-orchestration.md).

> **Codex sibling.** `/codex <task>` is the same surface for the OpenAI Codex CLI. Commands (`/codex`, `/codex_status`, `/codex_cancel`), Telegram reply-to-resume flow, and `/agents` integration mirror `/claude` exactly — only the executor (`codex_executor.py`) and the underlying CLI (`codex exec --json`) differ. Codex runs against your ChatGPT plan; everything in this document applies with `/claude` → `/codex` and `claude` → `codex` substituted, with two caveats: Codex isn't trained on the `[NOTIFY]`/`[CLARIFY]` protocol (final-message-only relay), and there's no plan-mode equivalent.

## How it differs from the agent worker

LifeOS has two related-but-distinct ways to run autonomous work on the operator's behalf. Don't conflate them:

| | Claude Code orchestrator (this spec) | Agent worker ([agent-worker.md](agent-worker.md)) |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Telegram `/claude <task>` (or auto-detect) | `#agent`-tagged Obsidian task |
| **Runtime** | Local `claude` CLI subprocess on the server | Stand-alone Python worker hitting llama-server or Anthropic Managed Agents |
| **State** | In-process; no persistent SessionStore | SQLite SessionStore + JSONL transcript per session |
| **Concurrency** | One session at a time | Many concurrent sessions, bounded by config caps |
| **Pickup** | Operator-driven (one-shot) | Worker-driven (poll loop) |
| **Resume** | Operator can re-launch from `/agents` (see [agent-viz.md](agent-viz.md)) | Operator can swap the task tag and re-queue |

Both surface on the `/agents` page side-by-side. They share the visualization layer ([agent-viz.md](agent-viz.md)) but not the execution layer.

---

## Trigger paths

The operator gets a Claude Code session through one of two paths:

1. **Explicit `/claude` command in Telegram**. The Telegram bot dispatches the body of the message to the orchestrator. Examples:
   ```
   /claude create a file called test.txt with "hello world" on the Desktop
   /claude write a backup script for the LifeOS data directory
   /claude add "integrate weather alerts" to the backlog
   /claude create a cron job that runs backup.sh daily at 2am
   ```

2. **Auto-detected via the chat intent classifier.** If the operator sends a natural-language message that the classifier tags as "claude intent" (terminal, filesystem, or browser work), the chat pipeline yields a `claude_intent` event and Telegram handles it identically to `/claude`. The plan mode, clarification, and notification flow are the same.

---

## Lifecycle

Each session moves through:

```
ACCEPTED  (Telegram ack message back to operator, with resolved cwd)
   ↓
RUNNING   (Claude Code subprocess emits stdout JSONL events; orchestrator parses)
   ↓
[optional] PLAN_PENDING   (plan-mode tasks: Claude proposes a plan, waits for approve/reject)
   ↓
[optional] CLARIFY_PENDING   (Claude asked a question; operator must answer)
   ↓
[optional] GOAL_PENDING   (Claude proposed a [GOAL]; operator approves to lock it — the worker then injects /goal on resume — or replies with changes to refine)
   ↓
COMPLETED  (subprocess exited; final summary sent to Telegram)
   or
FAILED / TIMEOUT / CANCELLED   (operator-visible terminal state with reason)
```

Only one session runs at a time. Sending `/claude` while a session is active returns an error message naming the current task plus a hint to use `/claude_cancel`.

---

## Plan mode

Tasks containing words like `refactor`, `implement`, `rewrite`, `overhaul`, `build a`, `set up a`, `add a new`, `create a new`, `remove all`, `delete all`, `migrate`, `replace`, `restructure`, or `integrate` trigger plan mode. Claude presents the plan via Telegram and waits for approval.

**Flow:**

1. Operator: `/claude implement a new health check endpoint`
2. Claude presents a plan via Telegram.
3. Claude asks: "Reply 'approve' to proceed or 'reject' to cancel."
4. Operator replies: `approve` (or `yes`, `go`, `ok`, `proceed`)
5. Claude implements and reports completion via `[NOTIFY]`.

To reject: reply `reject` (or `no`, `cancel`, `stop`).

While a plan is pending, normal Telegram messages still reach the chat pipeline — only short approval/rejection keywords are intercepted.

---

## Clarification questions

If a task is vague or ambiguous, Claude asks a clarifying question instead of guessing. The session pauses and the question is relayed via Telegram as **one message** carrying both the question and "Answer by replying to this message" — the operator's threaded reply lands on the message that shows the question itself.

**Flow:**

1. Operator: `/claude add this to the backlog`
2. Claude (single message): "The backlog has two sections (Work and Personal). Which one? — Answer by replying to this message."
3. Operator replies `Work` on that message.
4. Claude resumes with the answer and completes the task.

While a clarification is pending, all non-command Telegram messages route as the answer. The operator uses `/claude_cancel` if they want to chat normally instead.

**Note:** `no` is treated as an answer to yes/no questions, not as a cancellation. Use `/claude_cancel` to actually cancel.

---

## Goal approval

For longer or fuzzier objectives, Claude can propose a **success condition** with `[GOAL] <condition>` before it starts working. The session pauses and the goal is relayed to the operator as **one message** carrying both the proposed condition and how to answer it — the operator's threaded reply lands on the message that shows the goal itself.

**Flow:**

1. LifeOS (single message): the proposed goal, followed by "Reply to this message with 'yes' to lock this goal and start, or with changes to refine it." The instruction spells out that only a **threaded reply** (Telegram's Reply on that message) reaches the session — a plain chat message doesn't.
2. Operator replies `yes` on that message → LifeOS immediately acks ("✅ Goal locked — starting work now…"), then the worker locks the goal (it arms Claude Code's native goal mode by injecting `/goal <condition>` on resume) and Claude begins.
   Or: `make it also require the docs to build` → acked as a rework; the raw reply goes back to Claude, which re-proposes an updated `[GOAL]`.

Approval is recognized from short affirmatives (`yes`, `approve`, `go ahead`, `sounds good`, `lgtm`, …). A reply that also asks for changes (`yes, but make it stricter`) is treated as a refinement, not a lock. A reply landing on a goal message that already has an answer is acknowledged ("already in motion") rather than treated as a new report.

**Note:** `[GOAL]` is a first-class protocol tag with its own pending state (`REASON_AWAITING_GOAL_APPROVAL`). The doctor persona emits it as the gate of its goal-first pipeline (see [doctor-bot.md](../../guides/doctor-bot.md)).

---

## Telegram notifications

Claude sends three kinds of messages via Telegram:

| Marker | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `[NOTIFY] ...` | Progress checkpoint or completion summary | `[NOTIFY] Created backup script at ~/scripts/backup.sh and added daily cron job at 2am.` |
| `[CLARIFY] ...` | Claude needs an answer | `[CLARIFY] Which backlog section — Work or Personal?` |
| `[GOAL] ...` | Claude proposes a success condition to lock before starting; delivered as one message with the reply instructions when the session blocks | `[GOAL] All unit tests pass and the linter is clean.` |
| heartbeat | Every 5 minutes while running | `Still working... (5m elapsed)` |

Only `[NOTIFY]`, `[CLARIFY]`, and `[GOAL]` lines are relayed. All other output (tool calls, file reads, intermediate steps) stays in the subprocess. The heartbeat is sent by the orchestrator (not Claude) so the operator always knows the session is alive even when Claude is busy without notifying.

---

## Threaded replies — every session message is an anchor

Every operator-facing message a session sends — streamed `[NOTIFY]` updates, heartbeats, blocked prompts (clarify / plan / goal), completion and failure notices, and the acks LifeOS sends back — registers its Telegram message id against the session. A **threaded reply to any of them** routes back into that session:

- Replies to a blocked prompt answer it (clarification answer, plan approve/reject, goal yes/refine).
- Replies to a completion or failure notice reopen the session as a follow-up turn with full prior context.
- Replies to anything else (a status update, a heartbeat, an ack) are queued as a **context note** — quoted with the message being replied to — and delivered at the session's next turn boundary. A mid-run reply gets an instant "Noted — I'll pass this to the session at its next checkpoint" ack; a reply to a finished session wakes it back up.

Every message ends with a footer naming its affordance: **"↩️ reply in thread"** when a threaded reply reaches the session, or **"🚫 do not reply"** when it can't (e.g. a dead, unresumable session). A plain, non-threaded message never reaches a session — on an orchestration bot it starts a new one.

## Operator commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/claude <task>` | Spawn a new Claude Code session with the given task. Returns an ack with resolved cwd. |
| `/claude_status` | Shows task description, working directory, current status, elapsed duration, cost-so-far. |
| `/claude_cancel` | Terminate the active session immediately. Sends a cancellation notification. |

`/claude_status` and `/claude_cancel` operate on the single active session (if any). If no session is active, they return a message saying so.

---

## Budget model

The orchestrator enforces three caps from `.env` (see [configuration.md § Claude Code Orchestration](../../guides/configuration.md#claude-code-orchestration-code-telegram-command)):

| Cap | Default | What happens at the limit |
|-----|---------|---------------------------|
| `LIFEOS_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT` | 3600 seconds | Watchdog kills the subprocess; operator gets a timeout notification. |
| `LIFEOS_CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS` | 50 turns | Session terminated; operator gets a "max turns reached" notification. |
| `LIFEOS_CLAUDE_MAX_COST` | $2.00 USD | Session terminated; operator gets a "cost cap reached" notification. |

The wall-time cap is the backstop — the 5-minute heartbeat plus `[NOTIFY]` checkpoints mean the operator usually has earlier signals to react to.

---

## Directory resolution

The orchestrator picks the working directory from keywords in the task description:

| Task description matches… | Working directory |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "edit the backlog", "update my journal" | Operator's Obsidian vault (`LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH`) |
| "fix the lifeos server", "update sync" | `LIFEOS_CODE_DIR/LifeOS` |
| "update the <project> readme" | `LIFEOS_CODE_DIR/<project>` |
| "write a script", "create a cron job" | `LIFEOS_CODE_DIR` |
| anything else | `~` (home) |

If the resolution is wrong, the operator makes the task more explicit (e.g., "edit the LifeOS readme" instead of "edit the readme").

---

## Capability boundaries

### What the orchestrator can do

- Spawn a single `claude` subprocess at a time on the server.
- Pass it the operator's task as a one-shot prompt.
- Run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (no approval prompts) — Claude operates with the same filesystem and shell access as the operator.
- Use any MCP server configured for Claude Code on the server, including the LifeOS MCP catalog (see [mcp-tools.md](mcp-tools.md)).
- Send Telegram messages on the operator's behalf.

### What the orchestrator can't do

- Run two sessions in parallel — operator must `/claude_cancel` first.
- Stream every line of output to Telegram — operator gets `[NOTIFY]` checkpoints, not real-time stdout.
- Persist conversation state across runs — each session is one-shot. (Resume via `/agents` is a separate UI; see below.)
- Exceed the configured budgets — wall, turns, and cost caps are enforced externally.

---

## Resume from the `/agents` page

Every Claude Code session writes a JSONL transcript to `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session>.jsonl`. The `/agents` page reads those transcripts and shows finished sessions as nodes (inferred status: `inactive` after the most-recent-touch threshold elapses — see [agent-viz.md](agent-viz.md)).

The operator can click "Resume" on an inactive Claude Code session and the LifeOS server runs an operator-configured terminal launcher (`LIFEOS_CC_RESUME_CMD`) that re-opens a Claude session resumed from that transcript id. Gated by `LIFEOS_CC_RESUME_ENABLED`. Configuration in [configuration.md § Claude Code Resume](../../guides/configuration.md#claude-code-resume-agents-operator-controlled-re-launch).

This is operator-driven (you click it) and runs through the operator's terminal — the orchestrator itself doesn't resume sessions automatically.
