# Personal CRM — Dashboards & Insights

**Status:** Complete
**Owner:** CRM
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-05

The aggregated views that sit alongside the people list: Family Dashboard (`/family`), Me Dashboard (`/me`, the CRM landing page), Birthdays Page (`/birthdays`), and Relationship Dashboard (`/relationship`). Each surfaces interaction patterns and insights derived from the CRM data model.

See [crm-ui.md](crm-ui.md) for the CRM index and the sibling specs that cover people, interactions, and the graph.

Each dashboard's heaviest endpoint (its interactions/timeline aggregate, plus `/statistics`, `/birthdays/all`, and the default people list) is served from a short-lived server cache, bounded by a five-minute TTL: a repeat request with the same parameters, from any client, returns instantly and a change anywhere in the CRM data invalidates it well within that window — see [architecture.md](../technical/architecture.md) for how the cache is keyed and invalidated.

## Family Dashboard

`URL: /family`

Aggregated view of interactions across multiple selected family members. Lets you track engagement with family as a group and quickly see which member you've been out of touch with.

### Key behaviors

- **Hero stats show lifetime totals** from `PersonEntity` counters (`email_count`, `meeting_count`, `message_count`) — independent of any date range.
- **Hero stat pills are clickable** — they navigate to the Timeline tab filtered by the corresponding source type.
- **Year dropdown** controls the heatmap and volume chart range (up to 10 years) but **does not** affect hero stats.
- **Heatmap squares** are clickable — they navigate to the Timeline filtered to that date.
- **Default family members** are configurable; selection persists in `localStorage` as `familySelectedIds`.

### Family Stats API

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/crm/family/stats?person_ids=<csv>`

Returns lifetime totals across the selected family members.

```json
{
  "total_emails": 1247,
  "total_meetings": 156,
  "total_messages": 5623
}
```

Reads directly from `PersonEntity` counters — fast (no interaction queries).

### Family Interactions API

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/crm/family/interactions?person_ids=<csv>&days_back=365`

Used by the heatmap and volume chart. Aggregates interactions across all selected family members.

```json
{
  "daily": [
    {"date": "2026-01-15", "total": 5, "sources": {"gmail": 2, "imessage": 3}}
  ],
  "by_source": {
    "gmail": 450,
    "imessage": 2300,
    "calendar": 156
  },
  "total_interactions": 4500,
  "date_range": {"start": "2025-01-15", "end": "2026-01-15"}
}
```

`days_back` supports multi-year lookback (up to 10 years).

### Family Timeline API

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/crm/family/timeline?person_ids=<csv>&source_type=<opt>&date=<opt>&limit=100`

Returns interactions for any of the selected family members. Includes a `person_name` field so the UI can identify which family member each row belongs to.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "interaction-uuid",
      "person_id": "person-uuid",
      "person_name": "David Chen",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "source_type": "imessage",
      "title": "Text conversation",
      "snippet": "Happy birthday!",
      "source_link": "imessage://+15550123"
    }
  ],
  "count": 50,
  "has_more": true
}
```

Supports filtering by `source_type` and/or a specific `date` (drives heatmap-click navigation).

### Family Member Selector

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select family members...            ▼   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Select All] [Clear All]                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ☑ David Chen                            │
│ ☑ Maria Chen                            │
│ ☑ Sofia Chen                            │
│ ☑ Eli Chen                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Multi-select dropdown with Select All / Clear All. Selection persists to `localStorage`. Adding or removing a family member re-fetches all dashboard data.

### Clickable hero stats

Each hero-stat pill maps to a Timeline source-type filter:

| Pill | Timeline filter |
|------|-----------------|
| 📧 Emails | `source_type=gmail` |
| 💬 Messages | `source_type` ∈ {`imessage`, `whatsapp`, `signal`, `slack`} |
| 📞 Calls | `source_type=phone` |
| 📅 Meetings | `source_type=calendar` |

## Me Dashboard

`URL: /me` (default CRM landing page; `/crm` redirects here)

Owner's network health at a glance. Replaces the generic people list as the entry point.

### Components

- **Health score** — overall network engagement metric.
- **Neglected contacts** — people with declining interaction frequency.
- **Network growth** — new contacts over time.
- **Top contacts** — most-interacted people with strength indicators.
- **Messaging by circle** — interaction volume broken down by Dunbar circle (see [crm-people.md § Dunbar Circles](crm-people.md#dunbar-circles)).
- **Trends** — configurable trend period for interaction patterns.

### Heatmap window sizing

Unlike the Family dashboard's fixed year dropdown (defaulting to 10 years), the Me page's heatmap sizes itself from the actual span of interaction data: it calls `GET /api/crm/me/interactions/span` first, which returns the earliest and latest interaction dates (excluding self, hidden, and peripheral people — the same population `/me/interactions` aggregates) and a suggested `years` value clamped to 1–10. The page requests exactly that window from `/me/interactions` instead of always requesting 10 years and shrinking the display afterward once the (much larger) response arrives.

### API endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/crm/me/stats` | Aggregated owner stats (interaction counts, health score) |
| `GET /api/crm/me/timeline` | Owner's interaction timeline, paginated |
| `GET /api/crm/me/interactions` | Interaction data with trend and health-period support (heatmap, volume chart, trend visualizations) |
| `GET /api/crm/me/interactions/span` | Earliest/latest interaction dates and a suggested heatmap year count; used to size the heatmap window before the first `/me/interactions` request |

---

## Birthdays Page

`URL: /birthdays`

Dedicated view showing a 12-month heatmap of contact birthdays and a chronological list of upcoming birthdays.

### Components

- **Birthday heatmap** — 12-month calendar grid with days colored when contacts have birthdays. Hovering shows names; today's date is highlighted.
- **Birthday timeline** — chronological list of upcoming birthdays with filters.

### API endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/crm/birthdays/today` | Contacts whose birthday matches today's date (drives the toast notification) |
| `GET /api/crm/birthdays/all` | All contacts with known birthdays |

### Birthday toast notification

When contacts have birthdays matching today's date, a dismissible toast banner appears on CRM page load. The toast shows once per day (tracked via `localStorage`). Backed by `GET /api/crm/birthdays/today`; UI in `web/crm.html`.

---

## Relationship Dashboard

`URL: /relationship`

Therapy-informed insights and communication visualizations for a primary relationship (e.g., partner). Identified by `LIFEOS_PARTNER_NAME` and adjacent settings (see [configuration.md § Relationships](../../guides/configuration.md#relationships)). If no partner is configured (`partner_person_id` empty in `GET /api/crm/config`), the page renders a short empty state explaining what to configure instead of issuing any partner-scoped request.

### Therapy insights

Three-column grid:

| Panel | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **For Me** | Commitments and things to work on (extracted from therapy notes). |
| **For Partner** | Things the partner is working on. |
| **Fresh Ideas** | AI-generated therapist-style suggestions. |
| **Growth Patterns** | How the relationship has improved over time. |
| **Recurring Themes** | Patterns to watch. |
| **Strengths** | What's working well. |

Each panel has a refresh button to re-extract insights on demand.

### Communication visualizations

| Card | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **iMessage Dynamics** | Who initiates conversations and volume balance. |
| **Tone Evolution** | Emotional warmth over time, with view modes (combined / user-only / partner-only / both). Results are persisted per person/month and only recomputed when stale (see below); a manual refresh button forces recomputation of the full window. |
| **Interaction Intensity** | Daily connection rhythm over 12 months. |
| **Weekly Rhythm** | Peak connection days of the week. |
| **Beyond Texting** | Monthly activity breakdown by channel (email, calendar, etc.). |
| **Interaction Depth** | Quick texts vs deep conversations by time of day. |

### Tone analysis APIs

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/crm/relationship/tone-analysis` | Compact combined-score summary for any person with iMessage history: one score per month in the window plus trend/average, and a top-level `status` (`ok`/`no-messages`/`in-progress`/`failed`). `compute=false` (default) only reads what's persisted, no LLM call; `compute=true` runs the same recompute pass as the detailed endpoint. Shares the same store, chunking, and per-person lock as the detailed endpoint below -- one implementation behind both. Used by the person-overview Tone card (see [crm-people.md](crm-people.md)); the Relationship page's own Tone Evolution chart uses the detailed endpoint instead. |
| `POST /api/crm/relationship/tone-analysis-detailed` | Separate user/partner tone scores, one overall score per person per stale month, persisted so only stale months are ever recomputed. A stale month that couldn't be recomputed keeps its last stored score (the chart renders it as a dimmed point); `refresh=true` forces full recomputation. Full freshness/recompute mechanics and query parameters in [api-crm.md](api-crm.md#post-apicrmrelationshiptone-analysis-detailed); storage schema in [data-and-sync.md § Store Locations](../technical/data-and-sync.md#store-locations). |
