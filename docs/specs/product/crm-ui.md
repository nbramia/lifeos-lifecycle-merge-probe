# Personal CRM

**Status:** Complete
**Owner:** CRM
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-04

LifeOS's Personal CRM is built on top of the [two-tier data model](data-model.md) ([ADR-003](../../adr/003-two-tier-data-model.md)) and provides network management and relationship context across every observed touchpoint with the people in your life. The UI lives at `/crm`; the API lives at `/api/crm/*`.

The CRM is split across four focused specs by feature area — this file is the index.

**Primary use cases:**
- Network discovery: "Who do I know at company X?"
- Relationship visualization: "Show me my connections."
- Meeting prep context: "What do I know about this person?"
- Communication tracking: "When did I last talk to X?"

**Non-goals:**
- Outbound sales/marketing CRM features.
- Contact management (creating/editing raw contact details — the system ingests; the underlying sources own creation/edit).
- Email automation or scheduling.

## Sub-specs

| Spec | Covers |
|------|--------|
| [crm-people.md](crm-people.md) | Person list view, detail view, edit flows; the two-tier entity model; contact-source aggregation; split and merge operations; link overrides; relationship-strength scoring; Dunbar circles; the multi-stage person-facts extraction pipeline. |
| [crm-interactions.md](crm-interactions.md) | The interaction timeline and the data-source integrations behind it (Gmail, Calendar, iMessage, Apple Contacts, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal). |
| [crm-graph.md](crm-graph.md) | The D3 force-directed relationship graph; multi-source `Relationship` model; per-source counts; source-filter UI; edge-weight calculation. |
| [crm-analytics.md](crm-analytics.md) | Aggregated views: Family Dashboard (`/family`), Me Dashboard (`/me` — the landing page), Birthdays Page (`/birthdays`), Relationship Dashboard (`/relationship`). |

## Navigation

Moving between the CRM's dashboards (Me, Family, Birthdays, Relationship, and the person list at `/crm`) is entirely client-side: clicking a nav link updates the URL and dispatches straight to that dashboard's existing initializer, with no document reload — the same mechanism the page already used for person and tab navigation (see [Frontend § Client-Side Navigation](../technical/frontend.md#client-side-navigation) for the implementation). Browser back/forward restores the previous dashboard the same way. The nav link for the current view is highlighted; the `/crm` link always leads to `/me` (its direct-load redirect, unchanged), so it never highlights independently of the other four.

A dashboard's in-memory state (its own cached aggregates, e.g. the Me dashboard's fetched interaction history) persists for the life of the browser tab: returning to a dashboard with the same parameters re-renders from what's already held rather than re-fetching. A full page reload (or a direct link/bookmark) still renders every URL exactly as a fresh visit — only in-session navigation is memoized.
