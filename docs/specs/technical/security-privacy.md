# Security & Privacy

## Overview

LifeOS is single-user, self-hosted on Linux (or macOS). The threat model is fundamentally different from multi-tenant systems. There are no user accounts, no access control lists, no role-based permissions. The primary security concern is preventing data leakage beyond the local machine and ensuring that sensitive personal data is handled with appropriate care in code, logs, and API interactions.

## Guiding Principles

- **All data stays local by choice, not by default.** `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND` defaults to `anthropic`, which sends query text and tool results to the Claude API (see "What Leaves the Machine" below). Setting it to `local` keeps everything on-machine, but that's an opt-in, not the out-of-the-box behavior.
- **The LLM receives only query payloads.** The LLM call sends the user's question and relevant search results, never bulk data exports or full database dumps.
- **External service credentials are stored locally.** OAuth tokens, API keys, and session cookies never leave the machine.
- **Logs never contain personal data content.** Log entity IDs and counts, not message bodies, email content, or contact details.

## Data Boundaries

### What Stays Local

| Data Type | Storage Location |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Indexed content (notes, emails, messages) | ChromaDB vectors + SQLite metadata |
| CRM data (people, relationships, facts) | SQLite (`data/crm.db`) |
| Search indexes (BM25) | SQLite FTS5 tables |
| Sync state and job queue | SQLite (`data/jobs.db`) |
| OAuth tokens and API keys | `.env` file and service-specific files |
| Monarch Money session | `data/monarch_session.pickle` |
| Performance traces | SQLite (`data/perf_traces.db`) |
| Photos and media metadata | SQLite, local filesystem |

### What Leaves the Machine

Whether chat traffic leaves the machine depends on `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND`. The default is `anthropic`, which routes the live chat path (intent classification + agentic orchestration) through the Claude API. Setting it to `local` keeps everything on a local llama-server.

| Data | Destination | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Query text (≤64 tokens of classification output) | Anthropic API (default) — Claude Haiku | Intent classification (`code` vs. ambiguous vs. agentic) | Per user query, unless `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=local` |
| Query text + retrieved tool results | Anthropic API (default) or local llama-server | Agentic orchestration & synthesis | Per user query and per tool round |
| Email/note snippets for specialist tasks (web-search synthesis, fact extraction, relationship insights) | Anthropic API — Sonnet via `get_anthropic_llm()` (resolves from `LIFEOS_ANTHROPIC_SPECIALIST_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-5`) | Quality-sensitive sub-calls | Per tool invocation, regardless of backend setting |
| OAuth authentication flows | Google, Slack | Token refresh | Periodic |
| Reminder messages, sync summaries | Telegram Bot API | Notification delivery | Per reminder / nightly |

## Credential Storage

| Credential | Location | Format |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Anthropic API key | `.env` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...` (only needed with `LIFEOS_LLM_BACKEND=anthropic`) |
| Google OAuth tokens | `.env` + token files | OAuth2 refresh tokens |
| Slack tokens | `.env` | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...` |
| Telegram bot token | `.env` | `telegram_bot_token=...` |
| Monarch Money session | `data/monarch_session.pickle` | Pickle serialized session |

**Encryption at rest**: None beyond OS-level full-disk encryption (LUKS on Linux, FileVault on macOS). Credentials are stored in plaintext in `.env` and data files. This is acceptable for a single-user system with full-disk encryption enabled — the threat model does not include local attackers with disk access, as that would imply full system compromise.

## API Security

- **No authentication on local API.** The FastAPI server runs on `0.0.0.0:8000` with no authentication. This is intentional for a single-user system.
- **Network access via Tailscale only.** Remote access uses Tailscale (WireGuard-based VPN). No ports are exposed to the public internet.
- **No public-facing endpoints.** The server is not accessible from outside the Tailscale network.

## Data Deletion

- **ChromaDB**: Documents can be deleted from collections by ID. Deletion removes both the vector and metadata.
- **SQLite databases**: Records can be deleted via SQL. WAL mode means deletions are journaled before being applied.
- **BM25 index**: FTS5 entries are deleted alongside their source records in SQLite.
- **No global "delete all data for person X" command exists.** Deletion requires removing records from each store individually (ChromaDB, CRM SQLite, search index). This is a known gap.

## Privacy Constraints for Developers

These rules apply to all code changes:

1. **Never log personal data content.** Log IDs, counts, and durations — not message bodies, email content, names, or contact details.
2. **Use synthetic data in documentation.** All examples use generic names, fake email addresses, and placeholder content.
3. **LLM calls send minimal context.** Search results included in prompts should be the minimum needed to answer the query.
4. **No telemetry or analytics.** No usage tracking, no error reporting to external services, no crash dumps sent anywhere.
5. **No bulk data export APIs.** The API serves individual queries and CRUD operations, not data dumps.

```python
# GOOD — IDs and metadata only
logger.info(f"Indexed person {person_id}, {len(sources)} source entities")
logger.info(f"Search returned {len(results)} results in {duration_ms}ms")

# BAD — leaks personal data
logger.info(f"Indexed {person.display_name}: {person.email}, {person.phone}")
logger.info(f"Search result: {result.content[:200]}")
```

## OS Security Integration

- **Linux**: systemd service isolation. The API server and sync jobs run as user-level systemd services. No special permission wrappers needed.
- **macOS (Apple Data Agent only)**: FDA/TCC permissions are managed on the Apple Data Agent Mac for Apple data export. See [ADR-005](../../adr/005-external-venv-macos-tcc.md) for TCC background.
- **Full-disk encryption**: LUKS (Linux) or FileVault (macOS) assumed to be enabled. LifeOS does not implement its own encryption at rest.
