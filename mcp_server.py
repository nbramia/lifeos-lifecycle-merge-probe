Dynamic MCP Server for LifeOS API.

Automatically discovers endpoints from the LifeOS OpenAPI spec and exposes them
as Claude Code tools. No manual updates needed when the API changes.

Usage:
    python mcp_server.py

Register with Claude Code:
    claude mcp add lifeos -s user -- python /path/to/mcp_server.py
