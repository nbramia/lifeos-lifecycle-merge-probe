"""Production candidate publisher for the atomic two-parent merge design.

Order of operations is load-bearing: this module constructs the final
normalized candidate commit FIRST, then dispatches isolated verification
against that EXACT commit SHA, and only publishes once a required check
bound to a non-candidate-controllable identity confirms it passed. It never
verifies a PR head in isolation and then builds a separate, untested merged
tree — the tree that gets tested is byte-for-byte the tree that gets
published.

A cross-repository (fork) pull request is refused outright before any other
work: the atomic compare-and-swap this module relies on is a single-repo git
receive-pack transaction, and there is no equivalent transaction spanning two
repositories. This is a publication-authorization boundary, not merely a
cleanup nicety — a fork PR must never be silently published through a
same-repo-only mechanism that cannot actually protect it from a source-side
race.

Isolated verification runs on GitHub-hosted infrastructure via
``workflow_dispatch`` against the repository's own trusted workflow
definition (resolved from the base branch, never from the candidate's own
tree) — this module never executes candidate code itself. The required
check that authorizes publication must be issued by a dedicated identity
whose credentials are never available to any workflow the candidate can
influence; see ``docs/guides/candidate-verification-ci.md`` for the exact
trust boundary and setup.

    """Publish one same-repository PR through the full corrected flow.

    Order matches the module docstring exactly: the candidate is built
    (Step 2) before any verification is dispatched (Step 3), and the
    required check must reach ``success`` — bound to ``trusted_app_id`` —
    before ``publish_atomic`` (Step 4) is ever attempted. ``trusted_app_id``
    is required, not optional, here: this is the production entry point,
    and a name-only check match is exactly the forged-context vulnerability
    this design exists to close, so this entry point never falls back to
    it silently. The staging ref used for verification is removed
    afterward regardless of outcome; it is internal bookkeeping, not the
    PR's own source branch.

    The main advance and the source ref are published in ONE atomic
    transaction (main advances to the candidate, and the source ref is
    exact-leased and forward-advanced to the SAME candidate — never bundled
    as a deletion here): if the source ref moved during verification, the whole
    transaction — main included — is rejected rather than merging a
    candidate that fails to reflect the pull request's live state. Source-branch deletion
    follows a successful transaction as a separate,
    later, independently-leased step against the candidate SHA the source
    ref was advanced to by the atomic transaction rather than the pull request's initial
    head SHA — see
    ``cleanup_source_with_lease``. A source branch that gained new commits
    in that later window is safely retained instead of deleted.

    When ``delete_source`` is false, the source branch intentionally remains
    at the candidate SHA after the atomic publish; it is not restored to the
    original PR head. This preserves GitHub's native merged-PR bookkeeping
    while allowing operators to retain the source ref. Before construction
    and again immediately before publication, this entry point checks that no
    other open PR shares the same head repository/ref. These are point-in-time
    API checks, not a GitHub metadata lock; the dual ref leases still protect
    the final SHA race, while a branch policy or unique-ref convention would
    be needed to exclude a PR opened in the final API-to-push gap.

    ``expected_head_sha``, when given, must equal the pull request's current head
    before anything else happens. A caller that already validated some
    other evidence (e.g. a suite-verification record) against a specific
    head SHA passes it here so a commit pushed to the pull request in the gap between
    that validation and this call can never be silently substituted in —
    this function fetches the head fresh, it does not trust a value handed
    to it, so without this check a fresher, unverified head would just be
    published instead.
