"""
Build an isolated source snapshot of a candidate LifeOS checkout.

A "candidate" is the exact source tree currently under test: tracked files
(with whatever uncommitted edits are actually on disk, not just the last
commit) plus untracked-but-not-gitignored files. Copying that tree into its
own directory and running the application from there — instead of from the
shared checkout — keeps hardcoded ``Path(__file__).../data``-style stores
from resolving back into the operator's real checkout: every such path is
relative to *this* root instead.

This module is intentionally generic (candidate identity + a safe file
snapshot), not test-runner-specific, so it can be reused anywhere a
candidate-evidence snapshot is needed instead of growing a second
implementation.

Every file lands in the snapshot fully self-contained: an internal symlink
is rebased to a relative link that still resolves correctly *inside the
snapshot*, never one that reaches back into the source checkout. A symlink
(or any ancestor directory in its path) that would resolve outside the
source root is rejected without ever opening or `stat`-following it — only
`lstat`/`readlink`, which read a link's own stored text, determine eligibility.

    Raises ``UnsafeSymlinkError`` if any component — including one reached

    ``root/nested/sentinel.txt`` against ``root`` as a string prefix passes

    Only checking `os.path.islink` on that one joined path never catches
    this, because reaching that final component at all already means the
    escape happened one segment earlier. Walking ``nested`` and
