#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Idempotently install scripts/lifeos-agent-hook.sh into a Claude Code
# settings.json and a Codex hooks.json (#849), so this machine's CLI
# sessions register themselves with LifeOS on /agents.
#
# Usage: scripts/install-agent-hooks.sh
#
# Targets (override for testing against temp copies — never point these
# at anything but a scratch file outside a real run):
#   LIFEOS_CLAUDE_SETTINGS   default: ~/.claude/settings.json
#   LIFEOS_CODEX_HOOKS       default: ~/.codex/hooks.json
#
# What it does: for each event Claude Code and Codex support
# (claude_code: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SessionEnd; codex:
# SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop — Codex has no SessionEnd hook),
# appends one entry that runs lifeos-agent-hook.sh with that event's args,
# UNLESS an entry already exists for that event whose command contains
# "lifeos-agent-hook.sh" (identifies a prior run of this installer, so
# running it again is a no-op). Every other tool's entries — Orca, atuin,
# a legacy claude-session-pane.sh / codex-session-pane.sh entry — are left
# exactly as they were. Creates the target file (and its `hooks` object)
# if missing.
#
# The installed command is the absolute path of lifeos-agent-hook.sh in
# THIS checkout, resolved from this installer's own location, wrapped so
# a moved or deleted checkout never breaks the CLI:
#   bash -c 's="<path>"; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" <engine> <event>; exit 0'
#
# Does NOT write LIFEOS_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN anywhere — prints instructions
# for the operator to create the token/URL env file
# scripts/lifeos-agent-hook.sh reads.
#
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS's shipped bash) as well as Linux bash. No
# mapfile, no `${var,,}`, no associative arrays, no GNU-only flags.
# Requires jq (same dependency as the hook script itself).
