# LifeOS launchd environment wrapper.
#
# A launchd `EnvironmentVariables` dict is static at load time — unlike
# systemd's `EnvironmentFile=`, a launchd-managed service never re-reads a
# live .env, and it does not source the operator's shell startup file either.
# Neither `~/.zshrc` nor `launchctl setenv` reliably reaches a launchd
# service's process environment. Without this wrapper, required config
# (e.g. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, tokens the agent worker strips before spawning a
# CLI subprocess — see claude_code_executor.py's `_clean_env`) never reaches
# a launchd-managed service at all (#776).
#
# Every generated plist's ProgramArguments routes through this script first.
# It loads the project's .env (if present) into its own process environment,
# then execs the real command — the same ".env reaches the process
# environment at start" behavior a systemd service already gets via
# EnvironmentFile=.
#
# Deliberately NOT `source .env`: systemd's EnvironmentFile= is a plain
# KEY=VALUE parser — it never evaluates the value as shell — so `source`ing
# would be a meaningfully different (and riskier) analog: a value containing
# `$(...)`, backticks, or other shell metacharacters would be executed as
# code every time launchd starts this service, not treated as a literal
# string. The loop below reads .env line by line and exports each KEY=VALUE
# literally, stripping one layer of matching quotes — no shell evaluation of
# the value, matching EnvironmentFile='s actual semantics.
