# LifeOS Network Watchdog — gentle WiFi re-activation
# Runs every 2 minutes to detect a dead link and nudge it back online.
#
# The incident this guards against (2026-06-30 → 2026-07-08): the WiFi radio
# was deauthenticated from the AP (4WAY_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT), NetworkManager's
# activation then "failed", and the interface sat `disconnected` for 8 days.
# Autoconnect never resumed on its own — it only recovered when the operator
# manually re-activated the connection (`nmcli device connect`). Because this
# box is WiFi-only (no wired fallback), that took every remote surface offline:
# Tailscale, the Anthropic API, Google sync, AND every alert channel.
#
# GENTLE BY DESIGN (rewritten 2026-07-10). This watchdog does exactly ONE repair
# action: re-activate the connection (`nmcli device connect`) — the same manual
# step that recovered the outage above. It deliberately does NOT bounce the
# radio, reload the driver module, or restart NetworkManager. On the MediaTek
# MT7925 (`mt7925e`), those station-remove operations can deadlock the driver
# inside `mt7925_mac_sta_remove`, wedging NetworkManager in an unkillable
# D-state and forcing a HARD POWER-OFF (observed 2026-07-10, repeatedly). A
# gentle re-activate can't fix a truly wedged radio — but it also can't take the
# whole box down, which is the right trade for a WiFi-only host. A wedged driver
# is a reboot / kernel-update problem, not something a watchdog should fight.
#
# Opt-in: does nothing unless LIFEOS_NETWORK_WATCHDOG_ENABLED=true in .env. It
# runs as root (system oneshot) to call nmcli, so it stays off by default.
#
# Alerting is best-effort: while the link is down NO channel can reach out, so
# this posts a *recovery* notice once connectivity returns, reporting how long
# the link was down. Interface, WiFi profile, and gateway are derived at runtime
# — nothing machine-specific is hardcoded, so it is a no-op on hosts without a
# managed WiFi device.
#
# Linux: triggered by lifeos-network-watchdog.timer (installed by
# setup-systemd.sh). macOS: not applicable (launchd/networkd differ).
