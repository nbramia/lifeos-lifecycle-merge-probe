Run all CRM data source syncs with health monitoring.

This script should be run daily via launchd or cron. It:
1. Syncs all configured data sources
2. Records sync status and errors in sync_health.db
3. Logs all output for debugging
4. Sends Telegram notification with sync summary
5. Exits with non-zero status if any critical sync fails

Usage:
    python scripts/run_all_syncs.py [--source SOURCE] [--dry-run] [--force] [--trigger TYPE]

Options:
    --source SOURCE   Run only this specific source
    --dry-run         Don't actually sync, just report what would run
    --force           Run even if sync was run recently
    --trigger TYPE    How sync was triggered: scheduled (default), manual, startup

# to decide whether a sync was running — including an unrelated process that
# merely mentioned the script's name/path as an argument, which deferred
# deploys for no reason. A first fix (a pid-in-a-file marker, checked with
# `kill -0`) traded that for three new problems found on review: checking the
# marker once and then restarting later is TOCTOU (a sync can start in the
# gap); a marker's pid can be reused by an unrelated process after the sync
# that wrote it dies, reading as "still alive" forever; and one global marker
# can't represent two overlapping manual syncs — the second overwrites the
# first's marker and clears it out from under the still-running first sync on
# exit. A kernel-held advisory lock has none of these problems: multiple
# processes can each hold a shared lock concurrently (no single "the"
# marker), the kernel releases it the instant a process exits for ANY reason
# including SIGKILL (no stale state, no pid to reuse or misread), and there's
# no window between "check" and "act" because auto-deploy.sh holds its own
# (exclusive) lock across its entire restart section rather than checking
# once and proceeding. A module-level constant (not a function-local path) so
# tests can `patch("scripts.run_all_syncs.SYNC_LOCK_PATH", ...)` to point it
# at an isolated file, the same pattern test_run_all_syncs.py already uses
# for SYNC_SOURCES/SYNC_ORDER.
#
# Host-wide (under $HOME, not this file's own repo checkout) — found on
# review: this repo is routinely worked in multiple git worktrees, each with
# its own checkout-local data/ directory. A lock keyed to this file's own
# location would be invisible to auto-deploy.sh running from a DIFFERENT
# checkout, which would then restart services on top of a sync it can't see
# — exactly the OOM host-freeze this whole mechanism exists to prevent.

# module loads .env with override=True, so a LIFEOS_SYNC_LOCK set there

# setting it in .env (where every other flag these scripts read lives)
# would silently split the sync and the deploy gate onto two different

    Bounded, non-blocking retry — found on review: a plain blocking

# =============================================================================
# Transient-failure retry (issue #541)
# =============================================================================
#
# Mechanism chosen: a retry loop inside this orchestrator, around each
# per-source subprocess invocation. Rejected alternatives:
#
#   - systemd Restart=/OnFailure on lifeos-sync.service: restarts the WHOLE
#     run_all_syncs.py invocation, which would re-run sources that already
#     succeeded tonight (explicitly out of scope per the issue: "Retrying the
#     whole pipeline. A source that succeeded must not be re-run") and loses
#     the in-memory `failed`/`dep_skipped` sets that the depends_on skip logic
#     relies on, so a partial restart would have to re-derive that state from
#     the DB — more moving parts for less precision.
#   - A follow-up systemd timer some minutes later: same "whole pipeline"
#     problem unless it's taught to run only the sources that failed, which
#     means persisting failure state across a process boundary and adding a
#     second scheduled unit — more infrastructure than a loop that already
#     has that state in memory for free.
#
# A loop here keeps everything in one process, reuses the existing
# depends_on skip logic untouched (that skip happens in run_all_syncs before
# run_sync is ever called, so a dependency-skipped source is never retried as
# though it had failed), and lets one attempt campaign share a single
# sync_runs row — so the retry doesn't skew the duration/yield history that
# other detectors (#438, #494) rely on by counting one logical run twice.
#
# Idempotence: a retry re-runs a source's script from scratch, so a script
# that fails partway through (after writing some data) and then retries must
# not duplicate what it already wrote. This is not a new risk introduced
# here — the nightly sync already re-runs every script over overlapping
# windows every night, so a genuinely non-idempotent source would already be
# duplicating data on every ordinary night. A retry just does the same thing
# sooner. Verified per write path (not assumed):
#   - Sources writing through InteractionStore (most Phase 1/2 sources):
#     `UNIQUE INDEX idx_interactions_source_unique ON interactions(source_type,
#     source_id)` plus `INSERT OR IGNORE`/`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` in
#     interaction_store.py make a repeat write a no-op or a plain overwrite,
#     never a duplicate row.
#   - photos (sync_photos.py -> ApplePhotosSync): explicitly checks
#     `source_store.get_by_source(...)` before creating a SourceEntity, on
#     top of the InteractionStore guarantee above.
#   - monarch_money: `write_monthly_report` does a single `file_path
#     .write_text(content, ...)` — a full overwrite of a fixed-name file, not
#     an append. Re-running regenerates and overwrites the same file.
#   - google_docs / google_sheets: same full-overwrite `write_text` pattern
#     (gdoc_sync.py) as monarch_money.
#   - vault_reindex (IndexerService.index_all): explicitly designed to
#     survive a crash mid-run — progress is saved to a state file every 10
#     files, and both writes it makes per file are delete-then-add, not
#     append: `VectorStore.update_document` deletes existing chunks for that
#     file_path before adding new ones, and `BM25Index.delete_by_path` runs
#     before re-adding. Re-indexing the same file twice (which already
#     happens on ordinary incremental runs) is a no-op in effect.
#   - crm_vectorstore (person_indexer.index_person_to_vectorstore): same
#     delete-then-add pattern, keyed by `person:{person.id}`.
#   - push_birthdays_to_contacts: sets a single Apple Contacts field
#     (`setBirthday_`) to an exact value — setting it twice is the same as
#     setting it once, not an append.
# No source examined writes by unconditional append or by an external side
# effect (e.g. sending a message, charging something) that would make a
# repeat attempt unsafe. Per-source retry-eligibility metadata is therefore
# not needed — if a genuinely non-idempotent source turns up later, exclude
# it explicitly rather than adding a configuration surface for a
