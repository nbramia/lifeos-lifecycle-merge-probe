# Wrapper for run_all_syncs.py that ensures NVMe/Homebrew is accessible.
#
# /opt/homebrew is a symlink to the NVMe external drive. At 3 AM (when launchd
# runs the nightly sync), the drive may be asleep or unmounted, which breaks
# the entire Python venv since it symlinks through Homebrew.
#
# This wrapper:
# 1. Wakes the NVMe by touching the mount point
# 2. Verifies the Python venv can start
# 3. Sends a Telegram alert if it can't, so failures aren't silent
# 4. Execs into Python if everything is OK
