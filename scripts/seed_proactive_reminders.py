"""
Seed proactive intelligence reminders for LifeOS.

Creates three prompt-type reminders:
1. Pre-meeting prep (every 15 min on weekdays, checks for upcoming meetings)
2. Morning briefing (daily at 6:30 AM ET)
3. Weekly communication gap digest (Sundays at 10 AM ET)

Usage:
    ~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/seed_proactive_reminders.py [--dry-run]

Each module is a standard prompt-type reminder — no new infrastructure.
Delete any reminder via the API to disable it.

MEETING_PREP_PROMPT = """\
Check my calendar for the next meeting happening in the next 20 minutes. \
If there is no meeting in the next 20 minutes, reply with exactly "NO_MEETING" and nothing else.

If there IS an upcoming meeting:
1. Get the meeting details (title, time, attendees)
2. For each attendee, look up their profile and recent interactions
3. Check for any related tasks or notes about the meeting topic

Format your response as:

**[Meeting Title]** — [time]

**Attendees:**
- [Name]: [role/company if known]. Last interaction: [date, brief context]. [Any relevant facts or pending items]

**Context:**
- [Any relevant notes, past meetings on this topic, or related tasks]

**Suggested talking points:**
- [Based on pending items, recent interactions, or communication gaps]

Keep it concise and scannable. Only include information that's actually useful for the meeting.\
"""

MORNING_BRIEFING_PROMPT = """\
Generate my morning briefing for today. Use the following structure exactly:

**Today's Schedule**
Search my calendar for today's events. For each meeting, include the time and a one-line context note \
(who's attending, what it's about based on past interactions or notes). Flag any back-to-back meetings.

**Tasks**
List tasks that are due today or overdue. For each, include the task description and context. \
If there are no due/overdue tasks, say "No urgent tasks today."

**Human queue**
Call manage_human_queue with action "list" to check the Human queue — things only I can do that \
an agent has filed and is waiting on. Report only cards shown as 24h old or older, one line each \
with the title and how long it's been waiting. Skip this section entirely if there are none.

**Overnight Emails**
Search my email for messages received since 6 PM yesterday. Highlight only emails that seem \
important or actionable (not newsletters, automated notifications, or marketing). For each, \
include sender, subject, and a one-line summary.

**Relationship Check-in**
Check for communication gaps — anyone important I haven't contacted in over 14 days. \
Only mention the top 2-3 most relevant gaps, not an exhaustive list.

Keep the entire briefing concise — aim for something I can read in 2 minutes. \
Use bullet points, not paragraphs. Skip any section that has nothing to report.

If there is truly nothing to report (no events, no tasks, no emails), respond with exactly NOTHING_TO_REPORT\
"""

COMMUNICATION_GAPS_PROMPT = """\
Generate my weekly relationship check-in digest. \
Search for people in my network and check communication gaps.

For close contacts (family, close friends), flag gaps over 14 days.
For professional contacts, flag gaps over 30 days.

Format as:

**Close Contacts — Overdue Check-in**
- [Name]: Last contact [X days ago] via [source]. [One-line context of last interaction]

**Professional Network — Consider Reaching Out**
- [Name]: Last contact [X days ago]. [Brief context — what you discussed, any pending items]

Only include people where reaching out would be genuinely valuable. \
Skip anyone where the gap is expected or normal. \
Limit to 5-7 people maximum. \
If there are no significant gaps, say "All relationships are current — no action needed."\
