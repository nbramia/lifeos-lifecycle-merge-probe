# LifeOS Server Management Script
# Designed for reliable server management from Claude or command line
#
# Usage: ./scripts/server.sh [start|stop|restart|status|wait|preflight|classify-change|verify-deployed|restart-worker-detached|test-instance]
#
# Commands:
#   start                    - Kill any existing processes, start server, wait for health check
#   stop                     - Stop the server
#   restart                  - Stop and start the server
#   status                   - Check if server is running and healthy
#   wait                     - Wait for server to be healthy (use after manual start)
#   preflight                - Check prerequisites before first start
#   classify-change          - Print whether a diff needs a worker or api-only restart (#401)
#   verify-deployed          - Exit 0 only if the checkout is a real work tree on the expected SHA (#419)
#   restart-worker-detached  - Detached restart of lifeos-agent-worker for the doctor (#401)
#   test-instance ACTION     - Private, isolated candidate instance for tests:
#                              run|verify|stop — see scripts/test_instance.py --help. `run` is
#                              the one supported way to exercise a candidate: it starts an
#                              instance, runs a command against it, and always stops it — no
#                              detached "start now, stop later" mode. Never touches the shared
#                              lifeos-api service; this is the ONLY server.sh path that never
#                              calls kill_server/pkill/systemctl.
#
# Expected startup time: 30-60 seconds (loading sentence-transformers model)
