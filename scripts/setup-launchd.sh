# LifeOS Launchd Setup Script
# Generates plist files from templates and installs to ~/Library/LaunchAgents
#
# The operational body (prompting, generation, validation, install) is
# wrapped in main() and guarded at the bottom of this file — the pattern
# tests/test_deploy_drift.py established for scripts/auto-deploy.sh — so
# that sourcing this script never prompts, never touches
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and never calls a real `launchctl`. (Top-level
# variable assignments above and `set -e` still take effect on source, same
# as auto-deploy.sh; only the operational run itself is gated.)

# Found on review: checking only item 3 misses two real failure modes. A

# on every machine — checking only that validates nothing useful, while the
# actual script (item 4) — the one thing that can realistically be missing
# — went unchecked. When item 3's basename names a known interpreter, item
# 4 is checked too.
#
# The venv's own python interpreter is checked in addition to (not instead
# of) the specific binary: an empty or half-created venv (`python3 -m venv`
# ran but `pip install -r requirements.txt` never did) has neither; a venv
# with dependencies installed for one service but not another (e.g. crm-sync
# came up fine, api's uvicorn was never installed) fails only the specific
