"""
Post-sync consistency verification (Phase 7).

Checks cross-store data consistency after all sync phases complete.
Auto-fixes small issues, flags large ones for manual review.

Checks performed:
  1. Person stats — cached counts vs computed from interactions
  2. Orphaned interactions — person_id not in PersonEntity store
  2b. Hidden-person interactions — interactions for hidden (soft-deleted) people
  3. Stale merged IDs (interactions) — interactions pointing to merged person IDs
  3b. Stale merged IDs (relationships) — relationships pointing to merged person IDs
      (always auto-fixes, not gated by threshold — re-pointing is non-destructive)
  4. Self-loop and hidden-person relationships — always cleaned up
  5. Orphaned CRM records — per-table threshold for relationships, facts,
     overrides, source_entities with invalid person_ids
  6. Missing vault files — interactions pointing at notes that were moved or
     deleted; re-points moves, drops duplicates, flags ambiguous cases

Usage:
    python scripts/sync_consistency_verify.py --dry-run          # report only
    python scripts/sync_consistency_verify.py --execute           # auto-fix below threshold
    python scripts/sync_consistency_verify.py --execute --fix-threshold 20
