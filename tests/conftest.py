# Force CPU-only embeddings under pytest (#521).
#
# This host's iGPU has only 8 SDMA queues. `pytest -n auto` (see
# scripts/test.sh) spawns one worker process per core (16 here), and any
# worker that touches EmbeddingService would independently try to load the
# GPU model — several processes grabbing GPU compute queues at once is
# exactly the concurrency pattern that exhausted the queues and preceded the
# 2026-07-10 host freeze. Tests don't need GPU throughput, so hide the GPU
# unconditionally rather than relying on every future test to remember to.
#
# This MUST be a pytest_configure hook, not an autouse fixture. Fixtures run
# per-test, after collection — by which point pytest has already imported
# every test module (and conftest fixture module), and any of those imports
# could have already pulled in torch/ROCm, which reads these env vars once
# at process start and caches the visible-device list. pytest_configure runs
# immediately after conftest.py itself is imported but *before* pytest
# collects/imports any test module, so it's the latest point that's still
# early enough to change what torch sees.
#
# `scripts/test.sh` also exports these (defense in depth) so anything that
# runs outside pytest itself (e.g. a helper script test.sh shells out to)
# still gets a CPU-only embedding model.

    the maintainer's real server) — unlike the SQLite-backed stores
    elsewhere in this file, there is no local persist-dir to redirect to.
    ``_isolate_vault_indexer_stores`` above isolates the vault-indexing path
    by renaming the collection before construction; this fixture is the
    backstop for every *other* call site. 45 rows with
    ``/tmp/tmpXXXXXXXX/vault/...`` file_paths and real vault ``note_type``
    values turned up in the live ``lifeos_vault`` collection (#828) —
    debris from `test_indexer.py`/`test_integration.py`/`test_people.py`'s
    `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`-based vault fixtures, predating (or
    bypassing) that per-collection isolation.

    Rather than patch each of the many ``VectorStore()`` / ``get_vector_store()``
    call sites individually (``api/routes/{admin,ask,chat,search}.py``,
    ``api/services/{hybrid_search,person_indexer,slack_indexer,calendar_indexer}.py``),
    this patches the class's ``__init__`` in place: every one of those call
    sites imported the same class object (``from api.services.vectorstore
    import VectorStore``, or via ``get_vector_store()`` which resolves the
    bare name in ``vectorstore.py``'s own globals either way), so mutating
    its ``__init__`` catches all of them regardless of which module's
    namespace holds the reference — unlike #652's ``SessionStore`` fix,
    which had to swap the *class name* because that bug was about a default
    argument bound once at class-definition time; here we're validating an
    incoming argument, not changing a default, so patching the method
    in place is enough and doesn't disturb ``_isolate_vault_indexer_stores``'s
    own wrapper (it still resolves to the same, now-guarded, class).

    One caller is structurally outside this guard's reach:
    ``api/services/relationship_discovery.py``'s Slack-discovery path calls
    ``chromadb.HttpClient`` directly rather than going through
    ``VectorStore`` at all (read-only; already patched in its own tests).

    Every current caller in the test suite is fully mocked, so no test
    currently needs to opt in — but a future test that genuinely requires

    Unlike ``ConversationStore`` (which resolves its default path by calling

    that resolver is enough), ``SessionStore``'s default ``db_path`` is a
    plain default argument bound to ``DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` once, when
    ``session_store.py`` is imported — reassigning the module-level
    ``DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` constant afterward has no effect on later bare
    ``SessionStore()`` calls. So instead of patching the path, patch the
    class itself: every call site except a couple of always-overridden ones
    (``Worker.__init__``'s ``session_store or SessionStore()`` fallback,
    never hit because every test constructs ``Worker(session_store=...)``
    explicitly; ``api/routes/agents.py``'s lazy singleton, always
    monkeypatched directly by the handful of tests that touch it) imports
    ``SessionStore`` LOCALLY, inside the function that uses it, specifically
    so tests can replace the class in place —
    ``api/routes/hermes_proxy.py::_resolve_caller_session_id`` documents this
    explicitly. #640 added a caller-session lookup to that function's
    caller, ``_build_envelope()``; ``tests/test_hermes_proxy.py`` sandboxes
    its own tests with a per-test fixture doing exactly this, but every
    *other* test that reaches the Hermes envelope path had no such
    protection and wrote real rows into the operator's live
    ``data/agent_sessions.db``.

    Tests that construct ``SessionStore(db_path=...)`` directly are
    unaffected two ways over: most import the real class at module
    collection time, before this fixture ever runs, so patching the name
    afterward doesn't touch their already-bound reference; and for the local-
    import call sites that DO pass an explicit path (e.g.
    ``tests/test_agent_worker_mcp_exposure.py``'s
    ``SessionStore(db_path=mcp_server.AGENT_SESSIONS_DB)``), the replacement
    below is a subclass that only substitutes the tmp path for the *default*
    argument — an explicit ``db_path`` still passes straight through, same
    as the real class. (A lambda that ignored its arguments and always
    returned one shared instance — the shape ``test_hermes_proxy.py``'s own
    narrower fixture below uses, safely, because the one call site it
    targets never passes an explicit path — would break every explicit-path
    call site an autouse, suite-wide version of it touches.)
    ``tests/test_hermes_proxy.py``'s own ``agent_session_store`` fixture
    composes cleanly for the same reason this file's other isolation
    fixtures do: autouse fixtures set up before a test's explicitly-requested
    ones in the same scope, so its later ``monkeypatch.setattr`` on this same
    class name simply overrides this default for that test.

# pytest-playwright's browser fixtures, re-scoped from session to module.
#
# Why: pytest-playwright's `playwright`/`browser_type`/`browser` fixtures are
# session-scoped upstream -- one Chromium process and one Playwright driver
# connection shared for a worker's whole lifetime. The sync API's driver
# connection runs its event loop inside a *greenlet*, not a real OS thread
# (playwright/sync_api/_context_manager.py, PlaywrightContextManager.__enter__):
# `self._loop.run_until_complete(self._connection.run_as_sync())` is entered
# once and from then on is only ever *parked* via greenlet switches whenever
# the test thread calls back into Playwright -- the call does not return
# until `pw.stop()` (the `playwright` fixture's teardown) runs. `asyncio`'s
# per-thread "currently running loop" marker is cleared only in
# `run_forever`'s `finally`, which fires only when that call genuinely
# returns. With a session-scoped driver, therefore, once ANY test in a
# worker process has used Playwright's sync API the marker stays pointed at
# Playwright's loop for the rest of that worker's life, across every other
# test file the worker runs afterward -- and the next `async def` test on
# that worker (pytest-asyncio, `asyncio_mode = "auto"`) fails with
# `RuntimeError: Runner.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
# despite having nothing to do with Playwright. `--dist loadscope` groups tests
# by class for tests inside a class, by module for top-level functions, and
# hands scope groups to workers largest-first (pytest-xdist's
# `--loadscope-reorder` is on by default; command-line order only breaks
# ties), so which groups share a worker process, and in what sequence, shifts
# with the selection -- a worker can run a browser file's scope group and
# then an unrelated file's async test in the same process. The minimal,
# deterministic reproducer needs no xdist at all -- a single process running
# a browser file before an `async def` test:
#   pytest tests/test_voice_mic_block_ui_browser.py tests/test_agents_board_api.py::TestBoardStream -q
# The failure that module scope prevents is also reproducible against the
# session-scoped upstream fixtures the way it actually showed up in the full
# suite, under real parallelism:
#   pytest tests/test_agents_assignment_ui_browser.py tests/test_agents_board_ui_browser.py \
#          tests/test_agents_host_filter_ui_browser.py tests/test_agents_board_api.py -n 4
# -- with the browser files listed first; the async tests must land on a
# worker whose driver loop is already parked, and under the size-ordered
# hand-out this file order gets them there reliably on a four-worker run
# while the reverse order does not. See AGENTS.md § Testing.
#
# Module scope tears the driver connection -- and the loop it parks -- down
# at the end of every test FILE, before any other file's tests (including
# unrelated async ones) run on the same worker. `context`/`page` build on
# `browser` at function scope upstream (their definitions carry no `scope=`
# argument, and nothing in this repo overrides them), so this only changes
# how often the underlying browser process itself is recycled; per-test
# context/page isolation is untouched. All five fixtures move together:
# pytest forbids a broader-scoped fixture depending on a narrower one, so
# any of them left at session scope while `playwright` is module-scoped
# raises ScopeMismatch.
#
# Each override delegates to pytest_playwright's own fixture body via
# `.__wrapped__` (the plain function `@pytest.fixture` wraps on pytest >= 8's
# `FixtureFunctionDefinition`) instead of copying it, so what the fixtures
# DO always matches the installed plugin; only their scope differs.
# tests/test_fixture_scope_isolation.py fails loudly if a pytest-playwright
# upgrade renames or reshapes any of the five, rather than this delegation
# silently passing arguments in the wrong shape.
