"""
E2E tests for the pre-agent intent classifier.

After PR #89/#87, `classify_action_intent` returns only two categories
that change the downstream code path in `ask_stream`:
  - `code` — query needs Claude Code (terminal/filesystem/browser)
  - `ambiguous_task_reminder` — query reads as "task or reminder?" with
    no temporal marker, so we short-circuit to a clarification prompt

Everything else returns `None` and falls through to the agent loop, which
has dedicated tools (create_email_draft, manage_tasks, manage_reminders,
create_calendar_event, search_*, …) and routes the query itself. The tests
here verify exactly that contract — no LLM is called on the hot path.
