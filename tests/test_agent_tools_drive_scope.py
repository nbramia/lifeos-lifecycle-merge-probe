"""
Tests for Drive search scope disclosure in the chat tool surface.

Regression context: same bug class as tests/test_agent_tools_scope_widening.py.
search_drive asked Drive for only the five most recently modified matches per
account, said nothing about the cut or the ordering, and swallowed a failing
account into the same bare "No drive files found." An old document was therefore
systematically unreachable whenever a handful of newer files also matched, and
an expired token was indistinguishable from an empty Drive — so chat denied the
existence of a document that was present and indexed.

These tests pin the fix: a cap that matches the service default and discloses
itself when it binds, an explicit modification-time ordering (Drive has no
relevance sort — see _DRIVE_ORDERINGS) so old files stay reachable, per-account
failures named even when other accounts return files, and an empty result that
names the scope it searched instead of implying a fault.
