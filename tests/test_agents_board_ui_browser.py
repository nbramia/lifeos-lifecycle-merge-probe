"""Browser test for the /agents Kanban board (#850).

Serves `web/` itself from an ephemeral port (like
`test_voice_mic_block_ui_browser.py`) rather than pointing at a running API,
and stubs every `/api/` call the page makes — the assertions are about the
JS in `web/agents/board.js` and `web/agents.html`, not the live backend.
No `requires_server` marker, so this runs at pre-push
(`browser and not requires_server`).

Covers: drag between lanes (asserts the stubbed PUT lane body; asserts the
card does NOT move and a toast shows when the stub returns 500), drawer
notes edit + blur (asserts the stubbed PUT /api/tasks body carries `notes`),
filters including assignee=me and lane=human_queue combined, and (#859) the
assignment pickers mounted in the drawer — render from the model catalog,
one save per picker, the Open action's success and 409 paths, and that
scheduled cards render no pickers.

    """Stub d3 (offline CDN) + every /api/ call the page makes.

    `open_calls`: appended with each opened card id (POST
    /api/agents/board/cards/{id}/open). `open_response`, when given, is
    `{"status": <code>, "detail": <str>}` — the 409 failure path;
    omitted defaults to a 200 success. `GET /api/agents/models` is served
    from `_MODEL_CATALOG`; `GET /api/agents/hosts` from `_HOST_CATALOG`.

    `kill_calls`: appended with each killed session id (POST
    /api/agents/sessions/{id}/kill). `kill_status_code`, when given,
    is a one-element list read fresh on every kill call (mirrors
    `lane_status_code`) — a non-200 entry makes the kill stub fail.
    `kill_failures`, when given, makes a 200 kill response report those
    entries under `failures` (and an empty `killed` list) instead of a
    clean kill — the "the endpoint said OK but didn't actually kill
    anything" shape, distinct from `kill_status_code`'s transport failure.
    `task_deletes`/`schedule_deletes`: appended with each deleted id
    (DELETE /api/tasks/{id} / DELETE /api/scheduler/{id}); a successful
    delete also removes the card from `board_state` so a re-fetch shows
    it gone. `call_log`: when given, every kill and delete call above
    also appends an `("kill"|"task_delete"|"schedule_delete", id)` tuple
    here, in the order the requests actually arrived — for asserting a
    kill happened before its delete.

    `board_stream_frames`: SSE frame strings (each a full
    "event: board\\ndata: {...}\\n\\n" block), delivered one per *reconnect*
    — the first connection gets none, the second gets frames[0], the third
    frames[1], and so on. A `route.fulfill` response is a single static
    body, so it always closes the EventSource immediately after delivery;
    Chromium auto-reconnects per the SSE spec, and the `retry: 20` directive
    below makes that reconnect fast enough for a test to wait on.

    `stream_gate`: when given, every `/board/stream` connection is answered
    with an empty keep-alive (and a short `retry:` so the client polls back
    soon) for as long as `not stream_gate.is_set()`, checked fresh on each
    connection — never any real frame. Once the test calls
    `stream_gate.set()`, the next connection (at most one retry interval
    later) gets the real frame-delivery behavior. This check is a plain
    non-blocking `Event.is_set()`, called synchronously inside the route
    callback: Playwright Python's sync API dispatches every route callback
    on its one internal driver thread via a greenlet switch, so an actual
    *block* here (`stream_gate.wait()`) — or fulfilling from a separate
    thread to work around that — either freezes every other Playwright call
    the test makes or raises `greenlet.error: Cannot switch to a different
    thread` from `route.fulfill()`. Polling `is_set()` avoids both. Used to
    prove a frame provably arrives only after a specific point in the test
    (e.g. once a drawer is open and mid-edit) instead of racing page load on
    a fixed timer (#850 round-2 finding 5). `board_stream_frames` (and
    `board_state`, if the test wants the two to stay consistent) may be
    mutated by the caller any time before calling `stream_gate.set()` — the
    handler reads them fresh on the connection that delivers them.
