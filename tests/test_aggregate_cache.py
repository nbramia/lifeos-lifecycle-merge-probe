"""
Tests for the CRM aggregate response cache.

`AggregateCache` memoizes a route handler's return value, keyed on its
resolved query parameters, invalidated whenever either watched database's
`PRAGMA data_version` counter changes, so a second identical request is
served instantly until either database is written to (from any connection,
in this process or another) or a short TTL backstop expires. These tests
build isolated `AggregateCache` instances against temporary SQLite files --
the same pattern `tests/test_person_entity.py` uses for
`PersonEntityStore(db_path)` -- rather than the process-wide
`get_aggregate_cache()` singleton, so nothing here touches real data or
depends on run order relative to other test files.
