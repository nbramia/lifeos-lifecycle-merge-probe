"""
Static + integration guard: the seven cached CRM endpoints actually carry
the `AggregateCache` wrapper, and at least one of them demonstrably
invalidates through a real `TestClient` request when an external
connection commits to a temporary `crm.db`.

`tests/test_aggregate_cache.py` only ever decorates synthetic local
functions with `AggregateCache.cached()` directly -- deleting
`@cached_aggregate()` from every handler in `api/routes/crm.py` would leave
that file's suite fully green, so it alone doesn't lock in that the real
routes are wired up. This file does.
