"""
CRM Data Integrity Tests - P9.1

These tests verify that data flows correctly from sources to CRM display.
They use real production data and should pass when the CRM is working correctly.

NOTE: These tests require direct database access and will be skipped if
the server is running (database locked). Stop the server to run these tests.

IMPORTANT: These tests are designed for the developer's production environment.
When setting up LifeOS for the first time, you'll need to configure TEST_CONTACT_EMAIL
and TEST_CONTACT_PHONE with one of your contacts' information to verify integration.
