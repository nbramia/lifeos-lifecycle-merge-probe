"""API tests for CRM request hygiene:

- `GZipMiddleware` is scoped to `/api/crm/*`, `/api/people/*`, and the CRM
  page routes (`/crm`, `/me`, `/family`, `/birthdays`, `/relationship`, and
  their sub-paths) — the handful of routes with payloads large enough to be
  worth compressing. Streaming (SSE) endpoints elsewhere in the API sit
  outside this scope by construction (Starlette's `GZipMiddleware` also
  already refuses to compress `text/event-stream` on its own, independent
  of this scoping — see `api/main.py`).
- Those same CRM page routes send a short revalidation `Cache-Control` and
  honor `If-None-Match` with a bodyless 304, including the weak-validator
  (`W/"..."`) and wildcard (`*`) forms.

Most of this module imports `api.main` (`TestClient(app)`), which is a
heavy, one-time app initialization — following the precedent in
`test_chat_api.py`, marked `slow` rather than `unit` so it doesn't run in
the fast pre-push gate; it still runs under `./scripts/test.sh all`/`slow`.
`TestGzipUnitSynthetic` below is the deliberate exception: it uses the same
heavy fixture but is marked plain `unit`, because it's the only assertion
in this file that the gzip feature is ever actually applied without
depending on `data/crm.db` being present and large — everything else that
proves compression happens (`TestGzipScoping`'s two `integration`-marked
tests) skips cleanly on a fresh clone, which would otherwise leave nothing
in the default `unit`/pre-push scope asserting the headline behavior at all.
