"""Browser tests for CRM search cancellation and single-fetch person
selection.

Typing in the people search box must cancel the previous in-flight request
when it fires a new one, so a slower earlier response can't overwrite newer
results; and selecting a person must issue a single `GET /people/{id}`
request (with `include_related=true`), not two back-to-back requests.

Unlike most of the browser suite this serves `web/` itself from an ephemeral
port rather than pointing at a running API. Rather than intercepting network
requests with Playwright's `page.route()` (whose synchronous handlers run on
the single connection event loop, so a deliberate `time.sleep()` delay in
one handler serializes *all* route dispatch instead of modelling two truly
concurrent in-flight requests), this monkey-patches `window.fetch` itself
via an init script. That runs entirely inside the page on real
`setTimeout`/`Promise` concurrency, and — crucially — actually honors
`AbortSignal` the way a real network stack does, so these tests exercise the
real cancellation wiring rather than only the identity-check fallback.

Carries no `requires_server` marker, so it runs at pre-push
(`browser and not requires_server`).
