"""Browser test for the Me dashboard's span-driven heatmap window.

The Me page calls a cheap `/api/crm/me/interactions/span` endpoint first,
then derives the `/me/interactions` request's `days_back` from the
returned `years`, rather than always requesting a fixed 10 years of
interaction history (`days_back=3657`) and shrinking the displayed heatmap
to the actual data afterward. This pins that the page actually does that.

Unlike most of the browser suite this serves `web/crm.html` itself from an
ephemeral port rather than pointing at a running API, and stubs every
`/api/crm/**` call the page makes on load — the assertion is about the
network request `web/crm.html`'s own JS makes, not server behavior. That is
why it carries no `requires_server` marker, and so runs at pre-push
(`browser and not requires_server`). Keep it that way — reaching for a live
server here would silently drop this case from the push gate.
