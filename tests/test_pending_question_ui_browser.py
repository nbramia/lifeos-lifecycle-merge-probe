"""Browser test for the web /chat answer affordance (#412).

Drives the orchestrating-persona answer UI — the inline card that renders when a
conversation's spawned session is awaiting a `[CLARIFY]`/`[GOAL]` — with the
`/api/conversations/*` endpoints mocked via Playwright route interception. The
spawn → pending_question → render → answer → POST round-trip is exercised
deterministically, without a real doctor session or worker.

Verifies the FRONTEND: that a conversation whose `GET` returns a
`pending_question` renders the answer card, that Send POSTs to `/answer`, and
that a successful answer clears the affordance. The server-side deposit/resume
(#403) is covered separately; this never spawns a real session. Requires the
server serving the chat page on the owned candidate instance.
