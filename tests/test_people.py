"""
Tests for People Tracking functionality.
P1.4 Acceptance Criteria:
- Extracts person names from note content
- Handles aliases (Alex → Alex Johnson)
- Handles misspellings
- Tracks last-mention date per person
- Person filter works in search API
- "What do I know about Alex" returns relevant context
- Excludes self-references (configured user name)
