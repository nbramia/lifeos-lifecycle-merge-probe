"""
Tests for the `scripts/pre-push` gate's skip/run decision, its per-run log
paths, a graceful fallback when the configured log directory is unusable,
real runtime observation of the console output (not a source grep), and
pruning coverage.

The hook decides three things before running anything: skip a deletion-only
push, skip a docs-only push, or run the suites. That decision is pure, so we
exercise it without running any real pytest by invoking the hook in plan-only
mode with an injected file list:

    LIFEOS_PREPUSH_PLAN_ONLY=1 LIFEOS_PREPUSH_CHANGED_FILES="<files>" scripts/pre-push

The hook prints `prepush-plan: <decision>` and exits.

Every invocation below sets `TMPDIR` to the test's own `tmp_path`. The log-dir
setup (mkdir + prune) runs unconditionally, even in plan-only mode, so without
this every test in this file would create and prune directories inside the
real, shared `/tmp/lifeos-prepush/` that other agents' live gates write to.
