"""Guard tracked code against maintainer-specific values (#789).

This project is meant to be installable by anyone, but nothing previously
stopped maintainer-specific values from landing in the tracked codebase
itself. Three instances were found by a person reading the code by hand:
a hardcoded directory path rooted in the maintainer's own home folder
(#767), a specific computer model named in operator-facing alert text
(#770), and a data-store write restriction wired unconditionally to the
maintainer's own personal capture pipeline (#769). This module is the
standing guard against a fourth: a fast scan of tracked source for two of
those value classes, each with a maintained allowlist/denylist rather
than a fuzzy heuristic (see the third class -- #769's "hardcoded value
tied to one person's pipeline" -- is not something a text pattern can
express; it's out of scope for this scan, same as #789's own Out of Scope
section says).

Two scans:

1. `find_home_path_violations` -- an absolute path rooted under a real
   home directory (`/home/<user>/...`, `/Users/<user>/...`). A handful of
   docstrings in this repo already use paths shaped exactly like that as
   illustrative examples (e.g. "e.g. /Users/x/Notes/Work/note.md") --
   `_HOME_PATH_PLACEHOLDER_SEGMENTS` excludes the common placeholder
   tokens those examples use (a single letter, "user", literal "...") so
   the scan doesn't flag its own project's documentation. A *real*
   maintainer username is never one of these.

2. `find_hardware_name_violations` -- a specific device/computer model
   name (seeded with "Mac Mini", #770) in tracked source, allowlisted at
   the *file* level rather than by line number: line numbers drift as
   unrelated code above them changes (this repo's own issue tracker
   already needed a citation correction for exactly that reason), so a
   file-level allowlist is the more stable "known instance" record. A new
   mention in a file not already on the allowlist still fails.

Both scans exclude `tests/` (which is where this file itself and its
allowlists live -- the "check's own allowlist file" exclusion the issue
asks for) and `docs/`. Neither scan requires network access, a real
credential, a GPU, a running server, or writes to a real database --
`git ls-files` plus reading tracked files off disk is the entire
mechanism.
