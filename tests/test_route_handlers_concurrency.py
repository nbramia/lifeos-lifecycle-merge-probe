"""
A slow CRM request must not stall an unrelated fast one.

Every CRM/people handler with no `await` runs as a plain `def`, so FastAPI
dispatches it to the worker threadpool instead of running it inline on the
single event loop. A slow request (a full people-list scan, a relationship
tone analysis) must not block other requests on the process: `GET
/api/crm/config` must complete in under 100 ms while either is in flight.

This builds a router-only app (`FastAPI()` + `include_router(crm_router)`)
rather than the real `api.main.app`, and enters `TestClient` as a context
manager against *that* — a bare `client.get()` outside a `with` block gets
its own throwaway event loop per request and would never reproduce the bug,
but the real app's lifespan starts Telegram listeners, the scheduler, the
job-queue worker, and file watchers, and writes Dashboard files into the
configured vault — side effects a "unit" test must not have, and ones that
would collide with an already-running production server's own listeners on
a real deployment. A router-only app keeps the one thing the bug actually
needs (a single shared event loop dispatching `def` handlers to the
threadpool) without booting anything else.

Both slow requests are made deterministic by monkeypatching a store method
to sleep and return an empty result, so this does not depend on `data/`
existing or having any particular size:
- people-list scenario: `person_entity_store.get_all()` (what `GET
  /api/crm/people` calls).
- tone-analysis scenario: `interaction_store.get_for_person()` (the first
  blocking call in `analyze_relationship_tone_detailed`).
