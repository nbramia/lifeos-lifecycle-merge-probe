"""
Concurrent merges must serialize.

`merge_people` delegates to `scripts/merge_people.merge_people`, which
keeps a single global merge-intent log and does a read-modify-write of the
merged-ids file; two concurrent merges interleaving there can corrupt that
bookkeeping. `api/routes/crm.py` holds `_mutation_lock` (a module-level
`threading.Lock`) across `merge_people` and the other write handlers
(split, hide, review-queue confirm/reject, the sync-trigger POSTs) to
serialize them explicitly, since the CRM/people/photos handlers run as
plain `def` dispatched to the worker threadpool rather than start-to-finish
inline on the event loop.

This test proves the lock actually works: it patches the merge function
`merge_people` calls (`scripts.merge_people.merge_people`, imported locally
inside the handler on every call) with a fake that records whether it was
ever entered while another call was still inside it, fires two concurrent
`POST /api/crm/people/merge` requests, and asserts no overlap was ever
observed.
