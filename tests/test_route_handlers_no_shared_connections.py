"""
Static guard: no store reachable from the CRM/people/photos routers caches
a SQLite connection across calls, or opens one with `check_same_thread=False`.

These routers' stores must keep opening a fresh `sqlite3.connect()` per
call rather than sharing one across threads — that is what makes
dispatching their handlers to worker threads safe at all.

A cached connection would show up as an instance attribute assigned the
result of `sqlite3.connect(...)` (e.g. `self._conn = sqlite3.connect(...)`
in `__init__` or anywhere else) — the opposite of the established pattern
(`api/services/imessage.py`, `docs/specs/standards/python-conventions.md`
§ Database Access Pattern) of opening and closing a connection within each
method. `check_same_thread=False` is SQLite's own opt-out of the safety
check that would otherwise raise if a connection built on one thread were
used from another; needing it at all would mean a connection is being
shared across threads, which these stores must never do, since these
routers' handlers run on the worker threadpool.

One narrow, explicitly-marked exception exists: `PersonEntityStore`'s
persistent connection (`api/services/person_entity.py`,
`_get_data_version_connection`) is kept open across calls solely to read
SQLite's `PRAGMA data_version` counter cheaply -- every call site is reached
only while holding `_get_all_cache_lock`, so cross-thread use is serialized
and reopening it per call would defeat the point of caching `get_all()`. A
`sqlite3.connect(...)` call (or the `self.<attr> = ...` assignment wrapping
it) is exempt from BOTH checks above, but only when the marker comment
`# threadpool-safe: pragma-only, guarded by lock` (see `_MARKER` below)
appears on one of the source lines the call/assignment spans. Any other
`check_same_thread=False` or self-cached connection -- marked or not --
still fails the guard; the marker is not a generic escape hatch, it is tied
to this one construct via `test_unmarked_check_same_thread_false_still_fails`.
