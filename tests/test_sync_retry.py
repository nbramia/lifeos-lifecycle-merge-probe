"""
Tests for transient-failure retry in the nightly sync orchestrator (issue #541).

Regression context: the nightly sync fires once at 03:30 with no retry. On a
WiFi-only host, a momentary DNS blip (measured baseline: ~2-in-3 nightly
failures for gmail_personal/gmail_work/slack over six weeks, every failure a
name-resolution error) cost a full day of freshness even though the host was
online and healthy almost the whole time.

These tests pin: a transiently-failing source is retried and, on eventual
success, recorded as a success that needed a retry; a non-transient failure
is never retried; an always-failing source terminates within the retry
bound rather than looping forever; a first-time success records no retry;
a dependency-skipped source never enters the retry path at all; and the
sync_health schema migration preserves rows written before this feature
existed.
