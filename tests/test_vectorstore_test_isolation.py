"""Regression coverage for the #828 conftest guard
(``_guard_live_vectorstore_collections``) and its interaction with the
existing #288 vault-indexer isolation (``_isolate_vault_indexer_stores``).

Mirrors ``tests/test_session_store_test_isolation.py``'s approach for #652:
nothing here exercises the guard fixture explicitly (it's autouse), so
these tests are already running under it. What's asserted is the thing
#828 was actually about — a bare ``VectorStore(collection_name=...)``
pointed at a real production collection name must fail loudly instead of
silently opening a connection to the live server.
