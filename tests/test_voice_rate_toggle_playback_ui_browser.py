"""Browser tests for the 2x-toggle spoken-playback regression (#608).

Reported symptom: TTS worked for the first replies in a conversation, then
stopped -- later replies printed text but were never spoken. The transition
coincided with toggling the **2x** control.

Reproduction (see the PR description for the full trace): the actual defect
is not in `getPlaybackRate()`/`syncActivePlaybackRates()` -- toggling the
rate while a clip is genuinely mid-playback works fine and applies to the
clip already sounding. The real bug is in `unlockTtsAudio()`, which the talk
button calls on *every* tap, unconditionally, on the shared-audio-element
path used on iOS/Android (`useSharedTtsAudio()`). If a tap lands while a real
clip is still loading on that shared `<audio>` element -- its
`oncanplaythrough` handler armed but not yet fired -- `unlockTtsAudio()`
reassigns `.src` to a silent unlock ping out from under it. The real clip's
handler is never cleared, so it fires against the *silent* resource once
that becomes ready instead: `playUrlOnElement()`'s promise resolves, the
turn completes normally (text renders, no error), and the real clip is
simply never heard. `getPlaybackRate()` correlates with the bug only because
the user is more likely to tap talk again shortly after speeding a reply up
-- see `test_interrupting_tap_during_clip_load_...` below for the isolated
trigger, with no rate toggle involved at all.

Fix: `unlockTtsAudio()` now no-ops while a real clip is loading or playing on
the shared element, instead of unconditionally stealing it, via a new
`clipInFlight` flag (see `TestStrandedIsPlayingAfterAFailedTurn` below for why
that flag replaced the turn-lifecycle `isPlaying` it was first built on top
of, rather than just patching `isPlaying`'s own reset gap). Also adds the AC's
"say so" requirement: a genuine (non-benign) playback failure now surfaces in
the thread instead of only a console warning.

Unlike most of the browser suite this serves `web/` itself from an ephemeral
port rather than pointing at a running API, and drives `submitTurn()`
directly (exported from voice.js for exactly this -- see
tests/test_voice_backend_parity_ui_browser.py) since getUserMedia/
MediaRecorder don't run headless. No `requires_server` marker, so this runs
at pre-push (`browser and not requires_server`).

    `isPlaying` flag: `isPlaying` is set true by the `status_audio`/
    `main_audio` SSE events, but its success-path reset (`isPlaying = false`
    after `await playbackChain`) sat inside submitTurn()'s `try`, after the
    point where a turn that throws post-audio-event (a dropped stream, a
    server-side `error` event) exits. Unlike voiceBusy/state.isLoading,
    nothing in the `catch`/`finally` covered it -- stranding `isPlaying`
    true. Confirmed by reading the code, not conjecture, and independently
    by tracing the actual events.

    That stranding does NOT, empirically, produce "TTS silenced until
    reload": the very next tap's `if (isPlaying) { stopAllAudio(); return; }`
    branch in onTalkClick reset the flag (that's the cancel/replay-interrupt
    path, not a talk-to-record tap). But that self-correction fired at the
    wrong time -- before the real clip that triggered `isPlaying` had
    necessarily finished -- which could re-open the exact #608 race the
    first fix closed. `test_unlock_...` below pins that the unlock still
    works once the flag would otherwise be stuck.

    Simply moving the reset into `finally` looked like the fix, but traded
    that bug for a worse one: clips already handed to `playbackChain` keep
    playing after the SSE loop throws (the chain isn't cancelled by the
    generator unwinding), so a `finally`-only reset creates a window where
    real audio is audibly playing while the turn-lifecycle flag already
    reads "not playing" -- exactly when onTalkClick's stop-vs-record branch
    needs it most. `test_a_tap_while_the_reply_is_still_playing_stops_it_...`
    below pins that a tap in that window stops the audio rather than
    recording over it.

    The actual fix collapses `isPlaying` into `clipInFlight` entirely --
    tracked by playSingleUrl() itself, tied via `.finally()` to that
    specific clip's own promise, used by both unlockTtsAudio() and the
    stop-vs-record checks. There is no separate turn-lifecycle flag left to

        flow is already done -- voiceBusy/state.isLoading are both false)

        playing. A tap in that window must stop the audio (onTalkClick's
        `clipInFlight` branch), not fall through to start recording over
        the assistant's own still-sounding reply.

        This passes on unmodified `main` too -- there, `isPlaying` is never
        reset on this path at all, so it's accidentally still true and the
        tap happens to hit the stop branch anyway. It is not a guard against
        `main`. It guards against the *intermediate*, obvious-looking fix
        this PR considered and rejected: resetting `isPlaying` in `finally`.
        That reset is exactly what reopens this failure mode, because
        clips already handed to `playbackChain` keep playing after the SSE
        loop throws -- the turn-lifecycle flag goes stale exactly when this
