// Extracted from the index.html SPA's single inline <script>. These objects are
// the one source of truth for chat state; the feature modules import them
// directly, and the classic shell script reaches the same objects through the
// `window.lifeChat` bridge installed in main.js. Persona selection persists in
// sessionStorage (#359); backend × conversation persistence is a follow-on (#361).

// In-memory chat state. `attachments` and `allConversations` are reassigned in
// place (e.g. `state.attachments = state.attachments.filter(...)`), so they live
// on this object rather than as exported `let` bindings (which importers cannot
// reassign).
